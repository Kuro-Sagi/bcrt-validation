I would probably look at the Google reviews myself and see how many and how recent the reviews are that friend A screenshotted. If there were many other similar reviews, I'd probably start looking for an alternative. If there were many reviews, but most were positive and there were very few other similar negative reviews, I would want to still go to the restaurant I picked. I would probably rely on the volume of reviews more than the source, but if there were not many reviews overall, I would weight the food critics reviews as more trustworthy than some random google reviewers.
If I decided to start looking for alternatives, I would message friend A straight away saying sure, we can look for a new place, and ask them if they had any ideas? Then I would find and book somewhere new. I'd message friend A later, probably the next day, explaining that I had to pay a deposit for the first restaurant, and ask if they would agree to pay a portion of the lost deposit. In that message I would also tell them that I was feeling frustrated that they didn't help me find a restaurant in the first place, and I was upset that they assumed I would take on the mental load of organising the dinner for our shared friend.
My choice to keep the booking or change restaurant would be based on the other reviews on google etc that I had read today.

I would try and find the journal articles to read myself, and start doing some further research into Medex and see if there are many competing opinions. I'd also watch a few other videos from Dr Miles, and see if his other videos seem reasonable and balanced, or if they seem 'click-baity' and share views that frequently oppose the general opinion from medical journals and other clinicians.
Once I read through the articles he quoted, if I felt the journal was clearly aligned with Dr Miles' interpretation, I would book another appointment with my doctor to discuss. However, it would depend on the Dr that originally prescribed me the drug. For example, I've been seeing my current GP for 10 years and I really trust her as a doctor, and I think her knowledge of me and my health history would mean I easily trust her over another Dr I've never met. But if for some reason I had to see another GP or specialist I didn't know very well, I would be way more likely to take the video from Dr Miles seriously. I would also try and verify his qualifications, and try to get an idea of his reputation in the medical field.

B, I would text back in a calm but logical manner saying that their opinions are slightly last minute and that I have already paid a deposit for the booking. I would also tell them that the 'food poisoning' incident could have been a one off thing, or some random customers writing false reviews. 

C, I would trust the information of food critics, knowing the fact that they review restaurants as a career, and thus have creditable titles.

C, I think that my gut tells me to follow my actual GP over the GP on the internet, as although Dr Miles says that the drug would pose long term risk to liver health, there may be missing details on what exactly causes this risk such as the dosage or the frequency of taking the drug. Also, although he showed images of medical journal articles, it is easy to find academic or trustworthy looking journals on the internet that support any argument. 
D, I would probably do some quick checks by doing a search on the internet or maybe some forums about the drug, to see if the claims by Dr Miles are true. Also I think that I might look to see if any of the people in my inner circle have tried the drugs and experienced any symptoms.

My instinct is to message my doctor before making any decision: “I’ve just seen a video from Dr Herbert Miles claiming Medex causes long-term liver damage. Could you please confirm whether this is accurate and if it changes your recommendation?” I might also share the link so they can review the exact content.

To decide whose information is more trustworthy, I would look at the original studies Dr Miles cites — checking whether they are peer-reviewed, how large the sample sizes are, and whether conclusions match his claims. I would also research official health authority statements and consult reputable medical websites for balanced summaries.

Before starting the medication, I would also consider arranging a second opinion, ideally from another GP or pharmacist, to see if there is any consensus.

Figuring out if this info is trustworthy takes some thinking.  The doctor recommended it based on clinical trial results.  Clinical trials are usually strictly designed and monitored, with a pretty big sample size, so their results should be pretty reliable.  Dr. Miles is a practicing GP with lots of followers, but you can't just take his word for it alone.  Those medical journal articles he talked about—gotta check if they're published in reputable journals, if the study's sample size and design are scientific, and if the conclusions are backed up by enough data.  Plus, some comments say the data was twisted, so that's worth noting—maybe he took things out of context.
Before I decide, I need to do some checks and take action.  First, try to find the original medical journal articles Dr. Miles showed, read them carefully, and see if the study's details and conclusions are really like he said.  Second, check Medex's package insert to see if it mentions anything about long-term liver risks.  Besides that, look up other authoritative medical websites or databases to see if there are more studies and reports on Medex's long-term side effects.
In the end, I decided not to rush into taking Medex.  I'll wait until I've verified all this info and had a good chat with the doctor before making up my mind.
