I will ask friend A why she/he didn't reply to my messages before. It wouldn't be a confrontation since I know both will be attending friend B's birthday dinner, and I wouldn't want to risk tension between us, which may ruin the dinner. I'll confront friend B about it in a light-hearted manner, and depending on the truthfulness and apologeticness from his/her response, I'll consider whether I still want to remain close friends with them, or whether it's a stain on their character from my pov.

Afterwards, I'll definitely go check the Google reviews myself to confirm if friend A's information is trustworthy or not. After I get my answers, I'll either refute or agree with friend A, and if the information is as she says, I will change plans, and if it isn't, I'll keep the booking.

Just to add, realistically, we would tell friend B the plans a few days prior, just to see if she/he approves, as it is friend B's birthday, and it will also inform him/her of prior travel plans.","I will be concerned at first, and then question the reliability of the social media GP, because I personally don't trust medical practitioners who are extremely active on social media. 

I will go search for the journal articles myself, and judge whether the data presented is as he says, or overtly distorted by Dr Miles' personal opinions on the drug. I would also see if the article is reliable and peer-reviewed. I might also look at similar articles, and if it is as detrimental as he says, I'll send the articles to my own doctor, and ask for explanations. I'll switch doctors if I believe my own doctor isn't valid after his explanations.

If it isn't the case, and it doesn't pose a serious long-term risk, I'll still probably find another doctor and ask them if they also believe that I can use the drug. If this doctor also approves, I will use it.",3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,5 = Extremely Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,199.0,154.0,6.85,6.06,7.190000000000001,1.0,86.2,85.82,26.83,28.930000000000003,28.43,22.0,17.09,21.43,93.47,89.61,73.87,72.73,61.81,57.79,19.6,17.53,15.08,12.99,8.54,9.09,1.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.52,1.95,1.01,1.3,4.52,4.55,12.06,11.04,6.53,6.49,0.0,0.65,10.55,8.44,12.56,11.04,5.03,4.55,13.07,16.23,3.02,2.6,20.6,20.13,3.02,5.84,2.01,1.95,9.05,3.25,6.03,0.65,1.51,0.0,1.51,2.6,34.67,29.870000000000005,0.0,0.0,22.110000000000003,19.48,5.53,6.49,3.02,1.95,3.02,1.3,6.53,6.49,0.5,0.65,8.54,7.790000000000001,0.0,0.0,5.53,1.3,3.02,0.65,2.51,0.0,1.51,0.65,0.5,0.0,1.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.1,12.34,8.04,7.790000000000001,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.65,1.51,0.0,1.01,0.65,4.52,5.84,11.06,4.55,0.0,0.0,4.52,0.0,2.51,0.0,2.01,1.95,0.5,2.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,2.6,0.5,3.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,3.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.01,5.19,0.0,5.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.01,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.65,0.5,1.3,9.05,3.25,5.03,5.19,0.5,1.95,1.01,0.65,2.51,1.3,1.01,1.95,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,5.53,1.95,2.01,0.65,3.02,6.49,7.04,4.55,1.01,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.610000000000003,17.53,3.52,4.55,8.54,6.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.04,5.19,2.51,1.3,0.0,0.0,63

I think we should go, just warn friend B about possible food poisoning, besides, I already paid for a non-refundable deposit and I would hate for it to go to waste. If I didn't have to pay a non-refundable deposit then I'd straight away go to a new restaurant, but you didn't tell me early enough. Truthfully I'd ok with going to another restaurant but i don't know if there would be any spots available since its very late. Also, this restaurant has great reviews from food critics so I think it should be alright, but before I think we should go ask friend B's opinion since it's their birthday. If they want to go to another restaurant then we can go, but I think we should keep the booking for now since the deposit has been paid, we don't have much time until we actually meet up to find another place and there are plenty of good reviews.","Oh. I should go back to the doctor and show them the video and studies just to confirm whether Medex works well with minimal side effects. I would also do a bit of my own research online maybe on reddit to see what others who have used the medication are saying and if they felt anything different or bad when using it. I'll also research Dr Miles' credentials to see if he's legit because I can't trust GP's online because they're kind of content creators, and they're not always honest. I'll also check out those studies myself to see if he's omitting any information that might be cruical, for example, those people who suffered serious long-term risk to their liver health could have previously had liver troubles or drank too much or things like that.

R_9nP1v1oCAVi3ZEY,0,3.0,4.0,7.0,67,"I'm feeling annoyed that friend A is criticising the restaurant I picked when they didn't try and find an alternative, and especially because they are bringing this up so last minute. 
I would probably look at the Google reviews myself and see how many and how recent the reviews are that friend A screenshotted. If there were many other similar reviews, I'd probably start looking for an alternative. If there were many reviews, but most were positive and there were very few other similar negative reviews, I would want to still go to the restaurant I picked. I would probably rely on the volume of reviews more than the source, but if there were not many reviews overall, I would weight the food critics reviews as more trustworthy than some random google reviewers.
If I decided to start looking for alternatives, I would message friend A straight away saying sure, we can look for a new place, and ask them if they had any ideas? Then I would find and book somewhere new. I'd message friend A later, probably the next day, explaining that I had to pay a deposit for the first restaurant, and ask if they would agree to pay a portion of the lost deposit. In that message I would also tell them that I was feeling frustrated that they didn't help me find a restaurant in the first place, and I was upset that they assumed I would take on the mental load of organising the dinner for our shared friend.
My choice to keep the booking or change restaurant would be based on the other reviews on google etc that I had read today. I would feel inclined to keep the booking, almost out of spite that friend A didn't help to begin with, but also because I want to trust my research of good restaurants and I believe I'm pretty good at discerning these things.","My immediate reaction is to want more information. I would try and find the journal articles to read myself, and start doing some further research into Medex and see if there are many competing opinions. I'd also watch a few other videos from Dr Miles, and see if his other videos seem reasonable and balanced, or if they seem 'click-baity' and share views that frequently oppose the general opinion from medical journals and other clinicians.
Once I read through the articles he quoted, if I felt the journal was clearly aligned with Dr Miles' interpretation, I would book another appointment with my doctor to discuss. However, it would depend on the Dr that originally prescribed me the drug. For example, I've been seeing my current GP for 10 years and I really trust her as a doctor, and I think her knowledge of me and my health history would mean I easily trust her over another Dr I've never met. But if for some reason I had to see another GP or specialist I didn't know very well, I would be way more likely to take the video from Dr Miles seriously. I would also try and verify his qualifications, and try to get an idea of his reputation in the medical field. 
In this situation, I would do my own research, but only if there was heaps of well documented research that supported Dr Miles, I would trust my own doctor oveer him.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,321.0,244.0,31.13,16.31,3.26,1.0,96.38,84.75,28.56,37.96,29.180000000000003,27.11,18.69,18.85,97.82,90.16,76.64,72.13,60.75,57.79,14.95,17.21,11.21,13.93,8.1,10.25,0.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.28,2.49,0.41,3.74,3.28,17.13,16.39,8.41,4.51,0.62,0.82,10.59,9.84,10.28,8.61,6.23,6.56,9.35,10.66,1.25,0.82,20.87,18.03,8.41,6.15,4.98,6.15,4.36,4.92,4.05,1.64,0.31,2.05,0.0,1.64,34.58,29.51,0.0,0.41,25.86,23.36,7.48,6.15,2.18,2.05,5.3,5.33,5.3,4.92,0.0,1.23,7.48,7.38,0.0,0.0,4.98,2.05,2.8,1.64,2.18,0.41,1.87,0.0,0.62,0.0,1.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.9,9.84,5.3,6.15,0.62,0.41,0.0,2.46,0.62,0.41,0.31,0.0,2.18,0.82,5.61,3.69,0.0,0.0,1.87,0.0,0.0,1.23,0.0,2.05,0.93,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.0,7.170000000000001,3.28,1.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.05,3.28,1.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.49,4.1,0.0,4.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.62,0.82,0.62,0.41,0.31,0.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.18,1.23,9.03,4.1,9.97,8.2,2.18,0.41,1.25,0.0,4.36,4.92,2.8,2.46,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.41,4.67,3.69,6.23,4.92,2.49,1.23,0.0,0.0,0.62,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.28,12.3,3.12,3.69,4.67,5.33,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.18,2.87,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,43

First of all, friend A ignored my request for help a month ago, leaving me to handle the restaurant - booking alone. And now, just three hours before dinner, they come up with this concern.
I'd immediately reply to friend A, saying, ""It's a bit late to bring this up now. I trusted your help before, but you left me hanging. And the food critics have given this place great reviews.""
To judge which information is trustworthy, I know that food critics usually base their reviews on in - depth tastings and research, while the random Google reviews might be one - sided or even false. So, I'd quickly check if there are any official health reports about the restaurant.
I also considered calling the restaurant directly to ask about the food - poisoning claim. After making these checks and still finding no solid evidence of the food - poisoning incident, I'd decide to keep the reservation. The reason is that the positive reviews from food critics carry more weight, and it's too late to find another suitable restaurant with most nearby places fully booked.","When I watched Dr. Herbert Miles' video, I felt a rush of anxiety. I was relying on Medex to relieve my recurrent headaches based on my doctor's recommendation, but now I'm confronted with this serious long - term risk claim.
I'd like to message my doctor, asking for clarification. I'd say, ""Doctor, I just saw a video from Dr. Herbert Miles warning about the severe long - term liver risks of Medex. Is this true? You told me the side effects were mild.""
To determine which information is trustworthy, I'd look into the medical journal articles that Dr. Miles showed. I'd check if they are from reputable journals and if the research methodology is sound. I'd also consider the doctor's professional standing and the credibility of his sources.
Before making a choice, I'd contact my doctor's office to schedule a follow - up appointment. I'd ask for their opinion on these new concerns and if there are alternative medications.

When I made a reservation at a restaurant and paid the non-refundable reservation deposit, friend A didn't reply to me. Instead, three hours before the dinner, he told me that the restaurant I chose had a bad rating because some diners had food poisoning. This made me think that he was deliberately picking a fight with me. I would say to friend A, ""Then why didn't you tell me earlier? I had already paid the non-refundable deposit to this restaurant a month ago, and why did you only point out the problems with this restaurant on B's birthday? Since you didn't spend your money, weren't you concerned about this matter for the entire month?"" I would temporarily believe the food poisoning phenomenon that friend A mentioned and suspect that the food critics had fabricated the evaluation of this restaurant. Then I would go and check the Google reviews of this restaurant by myself. If the food poisoning was true, I would change my plan and cook a dinner for friend B to celebrate his birthday. If it was fake, I would keep the reservation and from now on, I won't have any contact with friend A.","I would subconsciously believe that Dr Herbert Miles' remarks saved my life.

B. I would (as nicely as I could) tell Friend A that they should have read some reviews earlier and actually helped me when deciding on a restaurant. 

C. It's hard to tell which information is more trustworthy, because on the one hand I don't want to get food poisoning (and the customers may have just been angry and lied in their review), but also food critics critique food as their job, so I would hope that they know what they're talking about. 

D. I would consult more reviews from other sources (not just Google Reviews) to gain a better understanding of the bigger picture and to see what others are saying. 

My final choice would be to keep the booking, due to the fact that it would be difficult to find another restaurant at such short notice and it's for a friend's birthday so I wouldn't want to change plans at the last minute and stress them out on their birthday. ","A. My immediate reaction would be one of dread, but it would quickly turn into suspicion. 

B. I would show my clinician the video and ask them about it. If my friends or family were also on the medication I would send the video and the mentioned studies to them just to let them know, probably by saying ""Hey, I'm not sure if you're aware, but this might be something you need to talk to your doctor about."" I'd try to word it in a way that wouldn't scare them, but would gently suggest that maybe there's a conversation that needs to be had with their doctor. If none of my family or friends were also on the medication, I probably wouldn't mention it to them. 

C. I would conduct my own research and consult additional sources (especially peer-reviewed articles) to gain a better understanding of the bigger picture and to better educate myself.

R_4s649qip03SoHtv,5,1.0,3.0,4.0,54,"Hmm… when I saw the message from Friend A, my first reaction was a mix of frustration and helplessness. I had asked them for help a month ago, but they never replied. Now, just three hours before the dinner, they suddenly show up with a screenshot of some negative Google reviews and say, “Maybe we shouldn’t go...” It feels like they didn’t really care about this gathering or take any responsibility.

I might reply to them first, saying something like: “It’s a bit late to bring this up now. I asked for your help earlier and didn’t get any response. I actually researched this restaurant—it has really great reviews from food critics.” I would try to stay calm though, because I don’t want this to affect the mood of the evening. After all, it’s for Friend B’s birthday.

As for the screenshot, I wouldn’t fully trust one or two bad reviews. There are always people online who have bad experiences, but I prefer to look at the overall rating, the number of reviews, and expert opinions. I remember this restaurant being recommended by several food blogs and review platforms, and many people praised the service and food quality.

To be extra sure, I’d quickly check a few more review sites—like TripAdvisor and Yelp—to see if there are any consistent complaints about food poisoning. If not, and things look generally positive, I’d decide to stick with the reservation.

My final decision is to keep the original plan. Here’s why:

It’s too close to dinner time, and most nearby restaurants are fully booked.

This is Friend B’s birthday, and I don’t want to ruin it with last-minute changes.

The restaurant has strong ratings and positive reviews from critics—one bad review isn’t enough to change my mind.

I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit.

I’ll arrive early to make sure everything is in order. If there’s anything unusual, I’ll handle it then. What matters most is that Friend B has a great birthday celebration.","When I first watched Dr. Herbert Miles’ video about Medex, I felt confused and a bit worried. I had just seen my doctor earlier that day, and she told me Medex was safe and effective, with only mild side effects. Now this popular doctor online was warning about serious long-term liver damage? It felt like a contradiction, and I didn’t know who to believe at first.

I wanted to message my doctor right away and ask, “Have you seen this video? Is it true what he says about liver damage?” I also thought about sending the video to a couple of friends or family members to hear their opinions. I trust my doctor, but seeing someone with a big following speak so confidently made me question things.

Before making any decision, I would do a few things:

1. Look up the journal articles Dr. Miles showed in his video and see if his interpretation matches the actual research.
2. Check whether those studies were recent, peer-reviewed, and supported by other research.
3. Look for other expert opinions from reliable medical websites or healthcare professionals—not just social media.

After reviewing everything, if there’s no strong scientific evidence to support his claims, and if my own doctor assures me again that Medex is safe for my condition, I would decide to **go ahead and take Medex**. I trust the medical advice from a trained professional who knows my health history more than a social media post, even if it’s from a licensed doctor. But I’ll also ask to monitor my liver just in case, and stay alert to any new research.

After I read the message, I would be severely irked but I would still reply cause at least they're putting in effort now... I would read the reviews that she sent and also, if I selected this restaurant it would have been because the reviews are positive and ive seen good stuff so I would tell her the other positive reviews. 

I would wait to see if she replies to these messages and see what she has to say. 

But I think I would still keep the booking, because non refundable, and if we all went and the vibe of the restaurant and the food isn't that good then I would suggest that we go to a bar or somewhere else.

I would immediately search up articles online, also I would definitely look at where Dr Miles got this information and data from, (ie any sort of research, articles and also maybe some other information from further medical clinicians). 

Then I would message my friends or acquaintances, maybe people who have used this medicine before and ask them.

Do you have specific concerns or just nervous about the google review?""

C. If there is a frequency of reviews then it is almost guaranteed to be true unless highly coordinated. I'd check news sources for this happening as there's a chance it could show up, and also maybe check something like a local subreddit for it.

The idea that Medex, which I’ve just been prescribed for headaches, could harm my liver is alarming, especially since the doctor mentioned minimal side effects. The images of medical journals he shows look convincing, but I don’t know if the data is being presented in the right context. My gut reaction is to feel a bit scared, but also skeptical because it feels like a lot of health claims on social media are often exaggerated or misleading.

I’d message my doctor right away to ask if they’re aware of any potential liver risks with Medex. I’d also talk to friends or family who are more knowledgeable about medications to get their perspective. I’d want to make sure the information I’m getting is well-rounded, so I’d also do some research myself, looking at reputable medical sources and possibly asking for a second opinion from another healthcare professional.

To decide which information is trustworthy, I’d prioritise sources like peer-reviewed journal articles, government health websites, and medical professionals over social media posts. I’d also cross-check Dr. Miles' claims with the package insert or official details on the medication.

In the end, my final decision would depend on the answers I get from my doctor and my own research. If the liver risk claims are confirmed, I might reconsider taking Medex or explore alternative treatments. However, if my doctor reassures me with scientific evidence, I’d likely proceed with the medication.",5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,73.0,250.0,12.85,46.85,6.83,1.54,21.11,87.28,63.379999999999995,8.89,18.25,20.83,24.66,28.4,94.52,90.4,72.6,60.0,60.27,48.0,16.44,12.4,13.7,10.4,6.85,8.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.48,0.4,0.0,0.8,2.74,2.0,13.7,12.0,9.59,6.4,0.0,0.4,5.48,12.0,13.7,10.0,5.48,4.4,6.85,8.8,4.11,0.4,24.66,17.6,1.37,3.2,0.0,3.2,4.11,2.4,2.74,1.2,1.37,0.0,0.0,1.2,31.51,33.2,2.74,0.0,13.7,25.2,4.11,8.0,2.74,3.2,1.37,4.0,0.0,6.8,0.0,0.0,5.48,6.0,0.0,0.0,8.22,2.8,5.48,0.8,2.74,2.0,2.74,1.6,1.37,0.0,1.37,1.6,0.0,1.2,1.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.7,9.6,5.48,7.2,1.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.37,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,4.4,8.22,2.4,0.0,0.4,1.37,0.4,0.0,0.0,5.48,0.4,0.0,2.4,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,10.96,3.6,2.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.37,3.6,6.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.74,7.6,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,1.6,0.0,0.0,1.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.37,1.6,0.0,1.2,5.48,4.8,5.48,8.4,4.11,2.4,0.0,0.4,0.0,3.2,1.37,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,4.11,2.4,4.11,1.6,4.11,5.6,6.85,1.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.48,17.6,5.48,5.6,0.0,5.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.2,0.0,1.2,0.0,0.0,90
R_4pDzw3tv0JSJIeL,10,4.0,6.0,10.0,57,"seriously? Friend A is only telling me this three hours before dinner? I’m a bit annoyed because they didn’t help at all with the booking and now they’re suddenly concerned. My gut reaction is that this feels like overreacting — the restaurant has good reviews from professional food critics, which I trust more than a few random Google Reviews. People complain online for all sorts of reasons, and sometimes those reviews aren’t even reliable.

I’d probably reply to Friend A with something like, “I get your concern, but it’s really last minute, and this place has been highly rated by critics. Are you sure those reviews aren’t just isolated incidents?”

To be sure, I’d quickly double-check the restaurant’s latest reviews, maybe scan their social media or any recent news about food safety. If there’s no widespread report of food poisoning, I’ll keep the booking.

Final choice: I’ll keep the booking because the critic reviews and lack of recent serious complaints seem more trustworthy, and changing plans now would be stressful and possibly ruin Friend B’s birthday.","My first reaction is worry — liver damage sounds serious, and I feel uneasy about taking Medex now. But at the same time, I remind myself that my doctor, who knows my medical history, recommended it and said the side effects are mild. Social media posts can be sensationalised to get attention, even if they show “evidence.”
I’d probably message my doctor or call the clinic tomorrow, saying something like, “I saw a video by Dr Herbert Miles warning about liver damage from Medex — is this a real concern?” I might also ask friends or family if they’ve heard anything similar, just to see if this is widely discussed.
To judge the trustworthiness, I’d look at whether Dr Miles cited recent peer-reviewed research or if the articles are old or taken out of context. I’d also check reputable health websites or government advisories.
Final decision: I’ll start Medex as prescribed for now because my headaches are recurring and my doctor assessed it as safe for me. But I’ll follow up with my doctor soon to clarify the liver risk and possibly explore alternatives if there’s solid evidence.

Secondly, I would like to communicate with clinical doctors that when prescribing over-the-counter drugs, detailed descriptions of the drug's effects and side effects should be provided, along with professional medical advice for patients to refer to, rather than simply stating mild side effects. Furthermore, regarding Dr. Miles' warning, a detailed understanding should be conducted on whether the long-term risk of this drug to the liver is within a controllable range. I will ultimately choose to continue taking this medication because Dr. Myers only introduced the side effects of this medication, but he did not provide a targeted medical assessment for my recurrent headache symptoms.

R_9dEoPRV5JbfOXpD,1,3.0,1.0,4.0,50,"When Friend A suddenly messaged about food poisoning claims at the restaurant, I felt a surge of frustration and suspicion. After being unresponsive for weeks, why raise concerns just three hours before dinner? The timing seemed calculated to create panic rather than solve problems.  

My immediate reply would be: *""Is this a recent review? The restaurant has excellent critic ratings, and we stand to lose our deposit. Honestly, why wait until the last possible moment to mention this?""*  

To properly assess the situation, I'd:  
1. Thoroughly examine the Google review - checking dates, credibility of the reviewer, and whether others reported similar issues  
2. Cross-reference with other review platforms and food blogs  
3. Call the restaurant directly to ask about recent health inspections  
4. Quickly research backup options, though chances of finding something good last-minute would be slim  

**Final Decision:**  
If the negative review appears to be an isolated incident amid overwhelmingly positive feedback, I'd keep the reservation - trusting professional critics' opinions over one questionable online review. The lost deposit would also factor into this decision. However, if I found multiple credible reports of recent health issues, I'd immediately contact Friend B to discuss alternatives, even if it meant paying another deposit elsewhere.  

Ultimately, I wouldn't let Friend A's eleventh-hour intervention derail plans without concrete evidence, but would prioritize everyone's safety if legitimate concerns emerged.  ","A. Immediate Emotional Reaction**  
My first reaction is a mix of confusion and anxiety. The doctor who prescribed Medex presented it as safe and effective, but now a seemingly credible source—Dr. Miles—is warning about serious liver risks. The conflicting information makes me uneasy, especially since headaches already impact my quality of life. I question why my doctor didn’t mention these risks and whether I’m missing critical information.  

**B. Communication with Others**  
I’d message my prescribing doctor: *""I saw Dr. Miles’ warning about Medex’s potential liver risks. Could you clarify if this applies to my case or if there are safer alternatives?""* To friends/family, I might ask: *""Have you heard about Medex’s side effects? A viral video is claiming it’s riskier than advertised.""* Their experiences could provide perspective.  

**C. Assessing Information Credibility**  
To evaluate the claims:  
1. **Verify Dr. Miles’ credentials**: Is he a reputable specialist, or does he have a history of controversy?  
2. **Examine the journal articles he cited**: Are they from peer-reviewed sources? Do the studies involve long-term human trials?  
3. **Check official health advisories**: Do FDA or other medical bodies mention these risks?  
4. **Review Medex’s official leaflet**: Does it disclose liver-related warnings?  

**D. Additional Actions**  
- Schedule a follow-up with my doctor to discuss concerns.  
- Research patient forums for firsthand experiences with Medex.  
- Consider starting with a half-dose while monitoring for side effects, if I proceed.  

**Final Decision**  
Unless Dr. Miles’ claims are backed by robust evidence, I’d likely take Medex as prescribed—but only after my doctor addresses the concerns. The clinical trial data and my doctor’s expertise outweigh a single viral video, but I’d stay alert for symptoms like fatigue or jaundice. If alternatives exist with similar efficacy but fewer risks, I’d request a switch.  

**Reasoning**: Medical decisions should prioritize trusted, verified sources over sensationalized claims, but patient advocacy matters too. I’d balance both by seeking clarification while proceeding cautiously.

My first gut reaction is fustration- I asked  Friend A to help plan this weeks ago, and now they suddenly come up with this warning at the last minute. I'm also worried about the risk: food poisoning is serious, but I also remember this restaurant has excellent reviews from professional food critics.
I would probably reply to Friend A riight away:""Thanks for flagging this- let me check quickyly, we can't afford to cancel for no reason.""
Then I would try to figure out whether these Google reviews are trustworthy. Are they recent? Do they look genuine or exaggerated? I might also check other review sites like Yelp or TripAdvisor for consistency.
Given that we’re so close to the dinner time, I’d probably also call the restaurant directly to ask if they’ve had any health inspection issues recently.
After weighing everything, unless there are many recent complaints, I’d keep the booking. The deposit is non-refundable, most restaurants nearby are likely fully booked, and the food critics’ reviews give me confidence. So my final decision would be: keep the reservation but stay cautious, and inform Friend B and the group so they can choose to go or not.","Oh no, this is confusing. My immediate gut reaction is anxiety and doubt — I trusted my doctor but now this video makes me worry about liver damage. I feel a bit overwhelmed because both seem credible: my doctor is a professional and so is Dr Miles.

I would probably send a quick message to a friend who knows more about health or medicine, just to see what they think. Then I might message my doctor: “Hi, I just saw a video warning about liver risks from Medex — is this something I should worry about?”

To decide what’s trustworthy, I would look at when the research Dr Miles shows was published — is it recent? Does it match what my doctor said about clinical trials? I’d also check official health websites like the Australian TGA or WHO for reliable information.

Before deciding, I would wait and maybe schedule a call with my doctor.

To decide if it’s true, I would look at the date of the bad reviews. If they are old, maybe the problem is fixed now. I would also check if many people said the same thing, or just one or two.

I might call the restaurant and ask if they had any food safety problems. If they sound honest and confident, I will feel better.

This doctor online is making a pretty good case with those articles he found and what if it messes up my liver long-term. I need to be cautious. Social media however tends to exaggerate things and strive on fear and drama. I'd probably contact my GP to see whether he has seen this video and if I should be concerned. I trust my doctor but I also want to show that I'm taking initiative. To figure out what's trustworthy, its best to check the image articles in the video and see if they are true and said what they said.

R_9tx5ryf4EHIGS7l,10,1.0,1.0,2.0,52,,"A. Immediate Emotional/Gut Reaction:
My first reaction is a mix of anxiety and confusion. The doctor prescribed Medex with confidence, but Dr. Miles’ warning about liver risks feels alarming, especially with the images of medical journals. I feel torn—should I trust my doctor or this online GP with a large following? The popularity of the post adds to my unease; if so many people are engaging with it, maybe there’s truth to it? But then again, the mixed comments make me wonder if the data is being exaggerated or taken out of context.
B. Communication with Others:
I’d probably message my clinician first: “Hi, I saw a video online warning about Medex and liver risks. Can you clarify if this is something I should worry about?” I might also ask friends or family if they’ve heard anything similar. Discussing it with them could help me gauge whether this is a known concern or just sensationalism.  
C. Deciding Trustworthiness:  
I’d compare sources:  
- Is Dr. Miles credible beyond his follower count? Does he cite specific studies or just show snippets?  
- What do reputable medical websites (e.g., Mayo Clinic, NHS) say about Medex?  
- Are the journal articles he referenced peer-reviewed, or is he cherry-picking data?  
The fact that comments are divided suggests the issue isn’t black-and-white, so I’d dig deeper.  
D. Checks/Actions Before Deciding:
1. Search for Medex + “liver risk” to see if other experts echo the warning.  
2. Check the prescribing leaflet for side effects—does it mention liver issues?  
3. Look up Dr. Miles’ background. Is he known for alarmist content or balanced takes?  
4. Consider my own health: Do I have liver concerns? Is the benefit of headache relief worth potential risks?  

Final Decision:  
For now, I’ll hold off on taking Medex until I hear back from my clinician. If they confirm the risks are minimal based on broader evidence, I’ll proceed cautiously. If not, I’ll ask for alternatives. Trusting a single viral video feels risky, but so does ignoring it entirely—so I’ll prioritize expert advice over online buzz.

B. I'd tell him or her that it would be too late to change the decision. I would advise them to not order or eat any raw food in case they were especially concerned about food poisoning.

C. In my opinion the Google Reviews can be easily fabricated, however it is also true that if a known food critic is eating at a restaurant, then the food they receive may often be prepared with greater care. Nevertheless I would say that the Google Reviews is by far the less reliable source here.

D. I would also call up the restaurant and enquire about the reviews, or enquire about the dishes that may cause gastrointestinal incontinence.

I would still keep the booking. I already paid a non-refundable booking, all the other venues are nearly full and Friend A had a lot of time to contact me about restaurant concerns. I also don't fully trust the authenticity of the concerns.","1. I would be a little concerned, but I personally trust my personal doctor over an online presence.

2. I would definitely contact my clinician first and ask about the veracity of Dr Miles' claims, as well as the clinical trials for Medex mentioned earlier. I would not contact my family or friends unless they were educated in a school of science and graduated recently. If they do, I would forward the articles mentioned in Dr Miles' video and ask them for their interpretation, and take their advice onto board.

3. I would decide which information is trustworthy depending on the number of scientifically educated opinions I receive for each side. Personally I would still have an inclination to trust my own doctor over Dr Miles.

4. If there is a genuine real concern for Medex causing liver damage, I think I would maybe even go to another doctor at another clinic and ask for their opinion, and whether there are any substitutes.

Depending on the information I am presented, I would choose to take Medex or ask for a substitute. However, I am more likely to take Medex just because I trust my personal doctor more than an online presence.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,0,1.0,1.0,194.0,201.0,26.76,42.93,9.05,2.46,45.7,87.2,27.02,42.34,13.859999999999998,15.46,20.1,22.89,90.72,90.55,70.1,67.16,61.34,54.23,12.890000000000002,13.93,9.79,12.44,6.19,9.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.03,0.0,2.58,2.99,3.0899999999999994,1.49,17.01,12.94,10.82,5.97,0.0,2.49,10.31,11.94,12.37,8.46,11.34,4.98,7.73,8.96,1.55,0.5,17.01,13.93,4.64,6.47,2.06,4.98,1.55,3.98,1.03,2.99,0.0,0.5,0.52,0.5,28.35,26.87,1.03,0.0,19.07,19.9,3.0899999999999994,4.48,1.55,1.99,4.64,3.98,5.67,4.48,0.52,1.0,4.12,6.47,0.0,0.0,3.0899999999999994,1.99,1.55,1.49,1.03,0.0,1.03,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.25,14.93,3.61,9.95,1.03,1.49,0.0,1.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,2.58,3.98,4.64,4.98,0.0,0.5,0.52,0.5,0.52,0.0,0.52,0.0,1.03,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.03,1.0,6.7,3.98,2.58,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0899999999999994,3.98,1.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.220000000000001,3.98,1.03,3.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.52,1.99,0.0,0.0,1.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.15,5.97,5.67,6.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,5.67,6.47,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.12,1.0,3.0899999999999994,1.49,3.61,2.49,1.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.34,11.44,7.220000000000001,6.47,2.06,3.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.03,1.0,1.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,60

“Hey, I get the concern, but I wish you brought this up earlier when I asked for help. I already paid a non-refundable deposit and the restaurant has great critic reviews too.”

I might glance at the reviews myself just to be sure, but unless the top ten all say “food poisoning,” I’m not worried. Plus, I already paid the deposit and it’s non-refundable, so changing plans now feels like a waste. Everywhere else is probably booked anyway.

I would go in with the plan and message them that it should be fine but I would most likely finalise the plan when we meet up together. If over text they don't mind eating then that would be fine, but if they show some resistance then we would talk it further in person.","It depends on how well I know my doctor, whether I met them for the first time today or our regular family doctor. If they were a doctor I knew well, I doubt they’d casually prescribe something with serious liver risks without mentioning it. 

Additionally, many sources online are inaccurate. Still, I don’t want to ignore it completely. I’ll probably just message my doctor tomorrow or call them and say, “Hey, I saw a video claiming Medex could have long-term liver effects""

As for now, I’ll still take the Medex. I trust the doctor who knows my history and gave me advice face-to-face. If anything sounds off after we talk, I can always stop or switch meds later.

I’ve already paid the deposit, and now, three hours before dinner, they’re raising concerns based on a few random Google reviews?

I’d reply: “Hey, I get your concern, but it’s really last-minute. The place has glowing reviews from food critics, and we booked it because nothing else was available. Why bring this up now?” I’d definitely re-check the reviews — not just the negative ones, but the overall trend. Are the bad reviews recent or isolated? Are they even about the same location?

I’d also quickly search for any official health inspection notices about the restaurant. If there’s no formal warning or consistent red flags, I’d trust the critics and the majority of diners who had positive experiences. Friend A’s timing seems off, and I can’t ignore that they didn’t contribute when it mattered.

In the end, I’d stick with the booking. Changing now would cause chaos, we’d likely lose the money, and it’s too late to rebook somewhere good. I’d tell everyone to show up — and maybe just avoid the oysters.","Whoa… that video has definitely shaken me up a bit. My gut reaction is anxiety — I mean, the doctor seemed confident, but now here’s another qualified doctor saying it could damage my liver long-term? That’s a pretty serious risk to just brush off.

The first thing I’d probably do is message my GP and ask if they’ve seen the video or heard of Dr. Miles. I’d want to hear their take directly, especially since they know my medical history. I might even share the video link with them. At the same time, I’d probably send it to a friend who’s into health science — just to get another view.

To figure out what’s actually trustworthy, I’d look up the journals Dr. Miles referred to. Are those peer-reviewed? Recent? Are his claims taken out of context? I’d also check other official sources — like the TGA or medical sites — to see if there are any warnings or updates about Medex.

Until then, I wouldn’t start the medication. I’d rather deal with headaches for a few more days than risk something irreversible.

I would tell Friend A that it would be too late to switch what restaurant we go to now and tell them that the reviews I saw online were really positive. Given that Friend A has shown some history in being unreliable and disorganised, I would choose to believe my own research that I've done on the restaurant to eat at since it seems that Friend A is wanting to potentially sabotage the birthday dinner or take credit for organising the celebration at the expense of me and my planning. I would double check that the reviews I saw were positive and send some screenshots of them to Friend A to further prove that we should go to the restaurant I chose. My final choice is that I would keep the booking since it's a nice restaurant with good reviews, and I'm skeptical that Friend A is trying to do something shady on Friend B's birthday.","While watching the video, I would feel some tension and anxiety over the reliability of Medex but would keep some skepticism as not everything on the internet is portrayed accurately. The further into the video I get however, the more nervous I would get as he supports his claims by showing images of medical journal articles, suggesting that the information he is presenting is backed up by other professionals and research conducted on the dangers of Medex. I would first message my family and friends telling them about the risks I saw about the drug and see if they had any additional input and I would then message my clinician asking about the risks and if they knew about it before prescribing it to me, and whether they believe Dr Miles is a trustworthy source of information. I would also try and get a second opinion from another GP and see whether they prescribe Medex as well, and if they don't, I would ask them if they knew about the side effects of Medex to be certain if my previous GP was prescribing me with a dangerous drug.

I think that we should just stick to the original booking, because its really close to Friend B's birthday and its also non-refundable. I'm assuming that the deposit is pretty pricey too. If Friend A actually responded to our text earlier about restaurant choices prior to putting in the deposit and warned about the food poisoning, then that would've given the opportunity to change restaurants earlier if they were concerned about food poisoning at the chosen restaurant. Also, unless Friend A has reviews or proof about the food poisoning, then I think, again, we should just stick to the original booking. I'm also assuming that we did more than enough research about restaurants in the area, that if there were any food poisoning cases, then it would come up. Thus, we should just keep the original booking.  ","The video from Dr Miles seems credible, but he only discusses the long-term effects of the drug. It would be a good idea to read some of the academic journals to see if they are helpful in understanding the side effects of Medex as well. Also maybe doing some general research about the drug and seeing what other medical doctors say would be good to see if there is a general consensus. I think I would take Medex only if it was for the short-term, in which I assume I am. If I had chronic headaches, then I would probably want to seek other forms of treatment and not just an over the counter drug.",3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,1,1.0,1.0,159.0,115.0,37.52,52.75,58.77,1.89,64.22,74.45,5.02,74.5,22.71,23.0,22.64,18.26,91.82,92.17000000000002,69.81,76.52,60.38,61.74,12.58,10.43,7.550000000000001,6.96,3.14,5.22,3.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.87,1.26,0.87,5.03,3.48,16.98,13.04,9.43,9.57,0.63,0.0,13.210000000000004,13.04,8.81,10.43,12.58,7.83,9.43,8.7,0.0,0.87,14.47,20.0,4.4,7.83,3.14,2.61,6.92,0.0,5.66,0.0,1.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,28.299999999999997,27.83,0.0,0.0,18.87,20.87,5.03,6.09,1.89,1.74,4.4,4.35,5.03,6.96,1.26,0.0,3.77,7.83,0.0,0.0,6.29,3.48,1.89,3.48,3.77,0.0,1.26,1.74,0.0,1.74,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.06,6.09,3.14,4.35,0.0,0.87,0.0,0.87,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.52,2.61,6.92,1.74,0.0,0.0,2.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.66,2.61,2.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.26,2.61,1.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.550000000000001,6.09,2.52,6.09,0.0,1.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.87,0.0,0.87,0.63,0.0,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.63,0.0,0.63,0.0,0.63,0.87,5.66,4.35,5.66,8.7,0.63,0.87,1.26,0.0,4.4,5.22,0.0,2.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.92,2.61,6.29,2.61,2.52,4.35,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.84,8.7,4.4,4.35,6.29,2.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.52,0.0,0.63,1.74,0.0,0.0,59

Additionally, considering I had paid out of pocket a non-refundable deposit, and also that at them point of friend A messaging the criticisms it would be too late to rebook another venue, I would be further agitated. 

While I do see the merit in checking the restaurants public reviews as the restaurant may have gone above and beyond to please critics and impact their reviews, the reasons cited above would prevent me altering my choice of restaurant.

In this scenario I would keep the booking due to the timing, the lack of input from Friend A and the out of pocket expense already incurred.","Due to the nature of this scenario I would be conflicted whether to trust the recommendation of my GP while also taking into account the advice of Dr Herbert Miles. However, understanding the nature of social media posting I would imagine that the information that Dr Miles reports on may not be 100% accurate and would thus require me to check his sources for the root of what he is saying.

If I were to return to my GP with the concerns that the social media post had raised I would ask if there was an alternative medication that I could take instead.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,1,1.0,1.0,153.0,103.0,79.1,47.22,20.0,1.1,56.02000000000001,65.99,20.23,20.23,38.25,34.33,22.22,18.45,89.54,91.26,69.28,66.99,60.13000000000001,60.19,11.76,15.53,7.84,9.71,6.54,7.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.94,1.31,0.0,3.92,5.83,17.65,16.5,12.42,8.74,0.0,0.97,16.34,13.59,11.76,11.65,4.58,4.85,5.88,6.8,0.65,0.97,18.3,15.53,3.27,0.97,1.31,1.94,3.92,0.97,3.27,0.97,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.61,25.24,0.0,0.0,13.07,18.45,5.23,3.88,1.31,0.97,4.58,4.85,0.65,2.91,0.0,0.0,1.31,6.8,0.0,0.0,4.58,1.94,1.96,0.97,1.96,0.97,1.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.5,13.59,3.92,11.65,1.96,0.97,0.65,1.94,1.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.65,7.77,4.58,1.94,0.0,0.0,2.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.94,0.65,3.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.65,3.88,7.84,1.94,3.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.61,1.94,1.96,0.97,0.0,0.0,3.27,0.97,0.0,0.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.31,0.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.94,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.190000000000001,0.97,8.5,6.8,0.0,0.97,0.65,1.94,5.88,4.85,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.92,1.94,6.54,2.91,0.0,0.97,0.65,0.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.84,4.85,2.61,2.91,3.92,0.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.65,0.0,0.65,0.97,0.0,0.0,55

D. Check that bad review is recently posted, if not they might have improve on food safety. It can also be purposely misleading review from other restaurant.

I tried to involve them and they ghosted me — I was the one who found the restaurant and paid the deposit. And now they send me a few bad reviews and want to cancel?

Okay, breathe. Let’s not overreact.

First of all, I know this place has amazing reviews from actual food critics — like in magazines and blogs. It’s popular for a reason. Sure, someone on Google said they got food poisoning, but those reviews can be unreliable. People exaggerate all the time online. One or two bad reviews among hundreds of positives? Not enough to panic.

I’d text Friend A back and say, “Thanks for the heads-up, but I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit and the place has great critic reviews. I think we’re good to go.”

Just to be safe, I’d check the restaurant’s Instagram or any recent posts to see if they’ve said anything about health concerns — maybe even call them quickly to confirm everything’s running smoothly.

Final decision? Keep the booking. We’re too close to the event to change now, and there’s no solid reason to believe this place is unsafe. Plus, Friend B deserves a nice dinner, not last-minute chaos.","Wait… what? Serious liver damage? But my doctor just said it was safe with mild side effects. This video is kind of alarming — and that guy, Dr Miles, is a GP, right? He sounds confident and even pulled up journal articles. Ugh, now I feel really confused and a bit anxious. I don’t want to mess up my health over a headache med.

I think I’d message my doctor — maybe something like, “Hey, I saw a video by Dr Miles warning about long-term liver risks with Medex. Just wanted to check if you’ve seen that data?” I’d probably also ask my friend who’s studying medicine what they think. They’re usually good at breaking these things down.

To figure out who to trust, I’d look at where the data is coming from. Are those journal articles peer-reviewed and recent? Or cherry-picked old studies? I’d also check if any official health bodies (like the TGA or FDA) have issued warnings or updated advice about Medex. If not, that says something.

Final decision? I’d pause taking Medex for now, until I talk to my doctor and check those articles myself. I don’t want to ignore a possible risk — but I also don’t want to overreact to a social media post.

I think I would mention the fact that I paid a non-refundable deposit and also mention the time and that we would have limited options to eat dinner elsewhere. Food critics typically are trustworthy due to their image and followers which respect their decisions. Google reviews are easily fabricated and are often non-truthful or are plagued by overly critical middle-aged individuals. I would investigate the google reviews to see when they were posted as well as the date of the last food critic review to check the recency of the 'food poisoning' claims. Ultimately due to the late notice, lack of input from Friend A and the abundance of good reviews from critics, I would keep and attend the pre-decided reservation. ","Immediately I would feel nervous and distressed about the risk of liver issues. I would immediately contact family and close friends to ask if they know anyone else taking Medex and if they know of the liver side effects. If their response supports the online doctor I would contact my clinician and question them about the liver effects and ask for an alternative. I would be sceptical about the social media doctor, as often they post controversial information in order to boost their views and income.

R_9Y5jqFKG2qMXrMH,1,1.0,1.0,2.0,54,"Before replying, I need to cool my tone so I don’t come off too harsh. But I’d probably text back something like:
“Hey, I get the concern but this is super last minute. I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit and most places are booked out tonight. Are you sure these reviews aren’t just outliers? The place has good critic reviews.”

Next, I need to think practically. How do I know which reviews to trust? Food poisoning reviews can happen at any restaurant, even top ones. Sometimes people post exaggerated stuff when they’re mad. I should check if these complaints are recent and clustered together (which could mean a real problem), or if they’re random and months apart. If most reviews are still positive overall, that’s a sign the place is generally fine.

I’ll quickly jump back onto Google and Yelp, maybe even look up their Instagram to see if any diners are posting stories today—do they seem happy? Also, I’ll search for any recent health inspection reports online. Usually if there’s a serious issue, it would show up there.

Assuming I don’t find anything urgent or consistent, I’m leaning towards keeping the booking. We’re too close to the event to scramble for a new spot without stressing everyone, especially Friend B—it’s their birthday and the last thing I want is to ruin the night with chaos.","y first gut reaction is confusion and anxiety. The doctor I trust said Medex is safe with minimal side effects, but now here’s this GP online claiming there are serious long-term liver risks? And he’s showing screenshots of journal articles, so it looks legit—but social media can be such a mixed bag. Part of me wonders: is this real science or sensationalism for clicks? Also, why didn’t my own doctor mention this?

Before panicking, I think I’d message my clinician—maybe send them the video link and ask, “Hey, I just came across this post about Medex. Is this something I should be worried about? Have you heard of any new research on liver risks?” I trust their medical opinion more than someone online, even if that person is a GP. But I still want to check—sometimes new studies come out that not every doctor sees right away.

As for figuring out what’s trustworthy, I’d want to actually look at the articles Dr Miles cited, myself. Are these real peer-reviewed studies from reputable journals? Are they case reports, large-scale trials, or just speculative editorials? And are the risks relevant to someone like me—taking Medex for headaches occasionally—or are they talking about people who take it daily for years?

I’d also check official sources: maybe go on the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) website or check other medical guidelines to see if any updated warnings about Medex have been posted. If this was a massive concern, I’d expect to see it reflected in mainstream health advisories, not just one viral video.",3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,228.0,263.0,12.06,24.04,6.61,6.55,99.0,64.4,39.38,20.23,14.25,16.44,20.61,22.05,92.54,88.59,69.74,66.54,53.95,50.57,14.91,14.45,9.21,8.37,6.14,5.7,0.44,0.0,0.44,0.38,0.0,0.38,2.19,1.52,5.7,6.08,10.53,10.27,5.26,3.04,0.0,0.76,8.77,11.41,12.72,9.89,9.21,7.22,7.89,7.6,1.32,1.14,19.3,17.49,8.77,7.22,2.19,3.42,1.75,2.28,1.75,1.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.14,39.91,30.04,0.44,0.38,23.25,19.39,5.7,3.42,0.44,1.52,3.51,3.04,9.21,6.84,0.44,1.14,6.58,6.08,0.0,0.0,5.7,3.8,3.51,1.9,2.19,1.9,2.19,1.52,0.8800000000000001,0.0,1.32,1.52,0.44,1.14,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.89,10.27,3.07,6.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.38,2.63,3.8,4.82,4.18,0.0,0.0,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.8800000000000001,1.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8800000000000001,1.9,4.39,3.8,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.07,3.8,0.8800000000000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.19,4.56,0.8800000000000001,3.42,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.32,0.0,0.44,0.76,0.44,0.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.28,1.75,1.14,10.96,7.980000000000001,13.16,9.13,2.63,2.28,1.32,1.14,7.89,3.42,1.75,3.04,0.0,0.38,0.44,0.0,8.33,3.8,1.32,2.66,9.21,6.84,0.8800000000000001,0.38,0.44,1.14,0.44,1.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.61,17.49,5.7,3.04,4.82,4.94,1.32,3.04,0.0,0.0,6.14,3.04,2.63,3.42,0.0,0.0,58

I would immediately tell friend A that I had paid a non-refundable deposit, and highlight how many established food critics had left high reviews. Following this, I would check the google reviews of the restaurant again (although might I add, I most likely probably already checked the reviews before booking, since I had seen reviews from food critics). If the reviews had a high volume of recent food poisoning reviews, then I would feel obliged to cancel, but would ask friend A to pay me half of the deposit, as we were meant to book this restaurant together anyways. If there was one or two food poisoning reviews, or if many of these alleged food poisoning reviews were not recent, I would make the decision to continue as A) food critics are often much more trustworthy than google reviews, unless there are multiple google reviews saying the same thing; B) most nearby venues are full and finding a new reservation would be a pain; C) I paid a non-refundable deposit that I would very much not like to lose and D) friend A ghosted me, and only texts me back now? If they had concerns maybe they should've played a more active role in finding a restaurant rather than offloading on me at the last minute.","Firstly, I would feel a little cautious, as I have received largely different endorsements of the drug from two practicing doctors. I would first read the comments saying the data is misrepresented, and gather some general trends amongst the comments. I would then try to skim some of the medical journal articles Dr Miles has referenced and ascertain for myself if the data is misrepresented. Following this, I would message my clinician with the video and what I had read in the journals and ask for their perspective on it. If they provide a convincing argument against Mike, I would feel comfortable taking Medex - if they do not address this long-term risk to liver health, I would probably ask for alternatives, or get the opinion of another doctor.

To explain our situation, I'd lead with the fact that it's too late to change the restaurant anyway, and if we didn't go, we wouldn't have a nice restaurant to go to. Then I'd explain the great reviews from the food critics. 
While food critics are usually more reliable than online reviews, I acknowledge that there may be biases. Restaurants usually treat food critics much nicer than regular guests. Online reviews may be more authentic, but people can easily lie due to any personal vendettas or even just for no reason at all. 
Since bad reviews are usually guaranteed regardless of how nice an establishment is, I'd consider the ratio of good to bad online reviews. Perhaps I'd try to look for the restaurant's food safety certificate and see how recent it was attained or how renewed. I'd consider the price of the non-refundable deposit as well as the general reputation of the restaurant.
Assuming there aren't any apparent red flags, I would keep the booking. The deposit is paid and changing plans so soon is a hassle. 
Assuming there aren't any significantly apparent red flags, I will keep the booking. e","My immediate reaction would be worry and panic, maybe relief that I haven't yet taken the drug.
I would consider the perspectives of other who say the data is misrepresented, as this is quite common in social media. I would fact check what they say by looking through the journal articles myself. If in doubt, I would consult my clinician and seek their advice.

Part of me feels slightly anxious—what if Friend B is right and we’re making a mistake sticking to the original plan? But another part of me feels defensive, like, ""Wait, we already booked this for a reason; I shouldn’t just change everything based on one message."" Emotionally, I feel torn between wanting to trust Friend B (since they might know something important) and not wanting to overreact.

If I had to say something to Friend A right away, I’d probably say, “Hey, B messaged me about this—do you think we should look into it? Maybe we should double-check before making a decision.” I wouldn’t outright cancel anything yet; I’d want to discuss it with Friend A first since we planned this together.

When it comes to deciding what’s trustworthy, I’d think about how reliable Friend B usually is. Do they normally share accurate info, or do they overreact? I’d also check if they provided any evidence or if it’s just their opinion. If it’s something important, I might look online or ask someone else who’s been there recently.

Before choosing, I’d definitely do some quick research—maybe check reviews, schedules, or official updates—and talk to Friend A about it. I wouldn’t want to waste money or ruin the plan based on a rumor.

My final choice: I’d keep the booking unless I find solid evidence that changing plans is necessary. Right now, Friend B’s message alone isn’t enough for me to switch. But I’d stay open to changing if I find reliable confirmation.","The moment I watch the video, my immediate gut reaction is anxiety and doubt. I feel slightly panicked because I was just prescribed Medex, and now there’s this doctor claiming it could seriously harm my liver. My first instinct is to think, “Wait, why didn’t my doctor mention this? Did they miss something?” but then I remind myself not to jump to conclusions based on a single social media post.

If I were to say something to anyone right away, I might message my clinician or pharmacist, asking, “Hey, I just saw a video about Medex causing liver damage long-term — is this something I should be worried about?” I might also talk to a family member, mostly to get some reassurance, but I’d prefer to consult medical professionals first.

To decide what’s trustworthy, I’d think about the sources. Dr Miles is a practising GP, but social media can often exaggerate things for views. I’d want to see whether his claims are supported by peer-reviewed studies, whether the journal articles he showed are credible, and whether health authorities like the TGA, FDA, or WHO have issued warnings.

Before making a choice, I’d check reliable medical websites, read independent reviews, and maybe book a quick follow-up call with my doctor to directly discuss the risk versus benefit for me personally.

My final decision: I’d hold off on taking Medex until I speak with my doctor again. The potential risk might be exaggerated, but I’d rather be sure, especially if there are alternative treatments for headaches with no controversy.",3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1,1.0,1.0,272.0,256.0,11.03,23.31,10.62,1.0,92.62,72.92,35.91,20.23,17.0,19.69,23.16,22.66,92.65,90.63,73.16,67.19,56.25,54.69,19.12,15.63,12.13,11.72,7.720000000000001,10.16,1.84,0.0,0.37,0.0,0.0,0.78,1.84,0.39,6.99,3.91,9.19,11.72,4.04,5.08,1.47,1.17,11.4,11.33,10.66,11.33,7.35,6.64,9.19,7.81,1.84,1.17,21.32,19.92,6.99,4.3,3.68,1.95,8.46,1.56,6.25,1.17,1.47,0.0,0.74,0.39,40.81,31.25,0.37,0.39,31.989999999999995,23.05,8.46,3.52,4.41,2.73,6.99,4.3,9.56,6.64,0.37,0.39,6.99,6.25,0.0,0.39,3.68,3.91,2.21,1.95,1.1,1.95,1.1,1.17,0.0,0.0,0.74,1.17,0.37,1.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.6,11.33,5.51,8.2,0.0,0.39,0.0,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.37,0.39,4.04,5.86,7.720000000000001,2.73,0.0,0.39,2.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.78,0.37,1.95,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37,1.95,1.47,3.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1,3.52,0.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37,6.25,0.0,5.08,0.0,0.39,0.0,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1,0.0,1.47,0.39,0.0,0.78,0.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39,0.0,1.56,0.37,0.0,10.66,5.47,5.88,5.08,1.47,1.17,0.37,0.39,2.57,1.56,0.74,1.95,0.0,0.0,1.1,0.39,6.99,4.69,2.57,2.73,5.15,4.69,2.21,1.56,0.37,0.39,0.37,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.32,19.92,4.78,3.91,5.15,8.2,1.1,1.17,0.0,0.0,6.62,3.52,3.68,3.13,0.0,0.0,47

A month ago, I contacted him to ask him to share the planning tasks with me, but he didn't respond at all. In the end, I did everything myself and paid the non-refundable deposit out of my own pocket. Now, with only three hours left before dinner, he suddenly pops up and says, ‘Maybe we shouldn't go.’ This really makes me feel unfair.
The most critical issue is that changing restaurants at this point is extremely difficult. We booked quite late, and the popular restaurants in this area are likely already fully booked. Changing locations at the last minute could ruin Friend B’s birthday, especially if we can’t find a new place to eat. B has been looking forward to tonight, and I don’t want him to feel like we didn’t prepare properly.

","This video is unsettling. My initial reaction was anxiety and confusion. I had just been reassured by my doctor, and now I see a doctor with a large online following saying that Medex could cause long-term damage to my liver? That's terrifying. Part of me wants to throw these medications away immediately. But I'm also a little sceptical—how do I know who's right?
I might send the doctor a message or call the clinic and ask directly, ‘I watched a video warning that Medex could cause liver damage. Should I be concerned about this?’

Reason

The credibility of information is weighed: The generally high praise from professional food critics weighs far more than a few unverified, anonymous Google negative reviews (especially those that have been ""carefully"" selected).
Urgency and feasibility: With only three hours left until dinner, it is almost impossible to guarantee finding a place of good quality and with a seat when changing locations at the last minute. The greater possibility is to cancel the entire celebration or end up in a worse restaurant.
Sunk cost consideration: That non-refundable deposit is no small amount. It feels so frustrating to lose this sum of money for nothing after friend A gave up.
The credibility of Friend A: His previous disappearance and lack of help, coupled with this sudden last-minute panic, make it hard for people to take his ""warning"" too seriously.
Risk mitigation measures: We will pay more attention at that time - order thoroughly cooked dishes, observe the atmosphere of the restaurant, and avoid the high-risk foods mentioned in the comments. If others seem suspicious, I will quietly remind everyone.","Here’s my unfiltered thought process after watching the video:

​​A. Immediate Emotional/Gut Reaction:​​
""Ugh, why now? Just when I felt relieved about finally having a solution for these headaches... This video instantly spikes my anxiety. The images of medical journals look legit, and he’s a real doctor with a big following—but is he exaggerating for clicks? I feel torn: my own doctor seemed so confident, yet this warning about ‘serious long-term liver risks’ is terrifying. Am I choosing between crippling headaches or ruining my liver? Why didn’t my doctor mention this? Now I’m second-guessing everything.""

​​B. What I’d Say to Clinician/Family:​​

​​To my doctor:​​ ""Hi Dr. [Name], I saw a viral video by a GP claiming Medex has significant liver risks not widely disclosed. Can we discuss this? Are the studies he cites credible?""
​​To a trusted friend/family:​​ ""Freaking out a bit—just got prescribed Medex, but this popular online doctor says it’s dangerous. What would you do? Feels like medical whiplash...""
​​C. Deciding What’s Trustworthy:​​

​​Source Motive & Credibility:​​
Is Dr. Miles genuinely warning people or chasing viral engagement? Check his past content—does he often make alarmist claims?
GP ≠ specialist: Is he a hepatologist or just citing studies he might misinterpret?
​​Evidence vs. Emotion:​​
He showed ‘journal images’—but were they screenshots of full studies or cherry-picked excerpts? Did he share journal names/dates so I can verify?
Clinical trials backing my doctor involved thousands; his ""evidence"" might be tiny outlier studies.
​​Consensus Check:​​
Do major health bodies (FDA, NHS) flag this risk? If it’s truly widespread, why isn’t it on Medex’s label?
​​Comments Aren’t Data:​​
Mixed comments mean nothing—crowds aren’t peer review.
​​D. Checks/Actions Before Deciding:​​

​​Cross-Check Official Sources:​​
Pull Medex’s FDA/EMA safety leaflet → scan for liver warnings.
Search PubMed for recent meta-analyses on Medex + liver risk (not single studies).
​​Contextualize the Risk:​​
How ""serious"" is serious? 1 in 100,000? Or 1 in 10? Are high doses/long-term use required?
Could risks apply to me? (e.g., I don’t drink alcohol, which often compounds liver strain.)
​​Consult My Doctor (Non-Negotiable):​​
Forward the video/link and ask: ""Can you address this specifically?""
​​Short-Term Safeguard:​​
If headaches are unbearable tonight, take half the dose while I investigate—avoid full commitment.
​​Final Decision & Why:​​
​​I’LL START TAKING MEDEX—BUT MONITOR CLOSELY & VERIFY WITH MY DOCTOR.​​

​​Why:​​

​​Trust Hierarchy:​​ My doctor’s direct clinical judgment + large-scale trial data outweigh a GP’s social media post—unless evidence emerges that contradicts this.
​​Benefit/Risk Calculus:​​ My headaches significantly impact my life; the proven benefit outweighs a theoretical long-term risk. OTC status implies safety for most users.
​​Mitigation Plan:​​
Immediately email my doctor with the video and request follow-up.
Start at the lowest effective dose.
Get baseline liver blood tests now and repeat in 3 months.
Track symptoms: if I notice fatigue/nausea/jaundice, I’ll stop immediately.",2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,0,1.0,1.0,180.0,478.0,82.09,31.81,53.33,10.98,55.540000000000006,70.77,6.08,22.85,20.0,10.62,28.89,28.45,91.11,80.96,63.89,54.6,47.78,39.54,8.89,12.13,2.78,8.37,0.56,5.44,0.56,0.21,0.56,0.42,1.11,2.09,0.0,0.21,6.109999999999999,3.77,16.11,10.04,8.89,4.18,0.56,1.46,13.33,6.07,4.44,7.95,6.109999999999999,6.49,6.109999999999999,4.81,1.11,1.67,8.89,13.39,8.89,7.74,7.78,3.35,5.56,3.35,2.78,1.88,2.78,1.05,0.56,0.63,25.56,25.1,1.6699999999999997,0.42,13.890000000000002,15.48,5.0,5.23,1.6699999999999997,2.72,0.56,1.46,3.89,2.9299999999999997,1.11,0.84,2.78,4.6,0.56,0.0,6.109999999999999,4.81,2.22,2.3,3.89,2.09,2.78,1.46,1.11,0.21,1.6699999999999997,0.84,0.56,0.42,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.0,0.0,8.33,10.04,2.78,5.02,1.11,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21,1.6699999999999997,3.35,5.56,4.6,0.0,0.42,1.11,0.21,0.0,0.0,1.11,2.09,0.56,0.84,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.84,5.56,4.390000000000001,1.6699999999999997,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.6699999999999997,4.390000000000001,2.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.89,8.16,0.0,5.859999999999999,0.0,1.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.0,0.0,3.89,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.21,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.84,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.21,0.0,0.42,2.78,3.14,0.0,0.0,7.22,5.23,8.33,7.53,1.6699999999999997,2.09,0.56,0.42,4.44,3.14,0.56,1.67,0.56,0.0,1.11,0.63,7.22,5.859999999999999,1.6699999999999997,2.09,2.78,6.49,1.6699999999999997,1.05,0.0,1.05,0.0,0.84,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21,0.0,0.0,17.22,34.1,5.0,7.109999999999999,3.89,2.51,0.0,4.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.18,8.33,16.11,0.0,0.0,36
R_2hBdnry1AtOl99m,10,2.0,3.0,5.0,54,"Oh no — my heart just dropped when I saw Friend A’s message. We’re only three hours away from dinner, and now I’m being told that the restaurant might have caused food poisoning? Seriously? After all this planning and stress — and especially after A completely ghosted me when I asked for help — this feels like a slap in the face.

My first reaction is frustration. I want to text A something like: “You ignored me for weeks and now suddenly you’re worried?” But I need to stay calm and think this through. I know I can’t just cancel last minute without checking the facts, especially since we’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit.

I’ll start by looking at the Google reviews myself. Are there multiple recent reports of food poisoning or just one or two random comments? I’ll also check the dates — maybe the issue was months ago and already resolved. Then I’ll search the restaurant’s name in local news or social media to see if anything serious was reported.

Given the restaurant’s strong reputation with food critics and how late it is to find alternatives, I’m leaning toward keeping the booking. But to be safe, I’ll call the restaurant directly and ask if they’re aware of any recent complaints. If they’re transparent and confident, I’ll feel better about sticking to the plan.

Unless I find strong evidence that it’s unsafe, I’ll keep the booking. It’s too late and too risky to change now, and Friend B deserves a well-planned birthday dinner — not chaos because Friend A suddenly panicked.
","The moment I saw Dr Miles’s video, my stomach dropped. I felt confused and honestly, a bit scared. My doctor had just told me that Medex was safe and effective, with only mild side effects — now someone online is saying it could damage my liver long-term? That’s a huge claim, and I don’t want to risk my health.

I would probably send the video to my doctor with a message like: “Hi, I just saw this — should I be worried?” I might also bring it up in a family group chat to see if anyone else has heard of these risks. But I also know social media can blow things out of proportion, and not everything online is accurate.

To decide what’s trustworthy, I’d look up the actual journal articles shown in the video, if possible, and see what the studies really say. I’d also check if any official health organizations like the TGA or FDA have issued warnings about Medex. Dr Miles might be right — but he could also be selectively presenting information for views.

Before I make a final decision, I’ll call my GP and ask about the risks and whether anything’s changed since the clinical trials. I’ll also ask if there’s an alternative to Medex that’s just as effective but with less controversy.

I'd probably say to friend a 'thanks for letting me know, however this restaurant has great reviews from food critics and I've already paid the deposit. also, there will be no where else to go at this time'. honestly, google reviews seem to be more reliable than food critics, since they may be paid to advertise the business. I would probably check if there are any undisclosed advertisements in the food critic reviews, as well as check whether the negative google reviews have anything in common (food poisoning associated with a specific dish). ultimately, I would keep the booking, because there probably isn't another restaurant open, and I'm annoyed at friend a for only helping at the last second. ","my immediate gut reaction is probably anxiety, because I'm hypochondriac leaning. I'd probably go do some online research from trusted science peer-reviewed articles. if these articles said that medex could, but doesn't necessarily pose serious long term risk, or just anything that isn't 'definitely causes risk', I'd probably feel less anxious. if the science articles said it doesn't, then I wouldn't take any action. if they say could, I'd probably go check back with my doctor. if they say 'will', then I'd freak out, check back with my doctor, and then if they continue to reassure me that it's fine, I'd find another doctor to go to. I'd also probably look into the comments who say that the data is being misrepresented. it's dangerous to fully trust people online- especially this doctor. there's biases in psychology that I learnt about, which makes us trust online actors more than we should, so I definitely wouldn't be quick to fully trust this online doctor.

I can’t believe they ghosted me back then, and now they’re suddenly worried because of a few Google reviews. This feels so unfair I put in the effort, paid the deposit, and now they want to derail the whole plan.

Okay, breathe. Let me look at the screenshots they sent. Yeah, a couple of people are complaining about food poisoning, but I also remember reading reviews from actual food critics who raved about this place. It’s not like every restaurant has perfect reviews even good places can have the occasional bad night. Still, I should double-check. I’ll quickly look up more recent reviews, maybe on a few different platforms like TripAdvisor or even Instagram to see if anyone’s posting about it tonight.

Also, I’ll call the restaurant not to cancel, just to ask a few questions casually. Like what their food safety rating is or if they’ve had any recent complaints. If anything seemed sketchy, I’d feel it.

As for Friend A, I’m tempted to just ignore the message, but I’ll keep it civil. Something like: “I’ve seen some great critic reviews and checked the food safety rating everything looks good. Given the short notice and non-refundable deposit, we’re still going. I hope you’ll come!”

Bottom line: we’re going. Friend B deserves a proper celebration, and this was the best option we had. I’ve done my homework.","Liver damage? That’s not what my doctor said at all. This is kind of scary. I was feeling okay about taking Medex, especially since my doctor seemed confident it was safe and even said side effects were mild. But now I’m seeing this video from Dr Miles and he’s an actual GP with journal articles backing him up? I don’t want to mess around with my liver, especially if there’s a real risk.

At the same time, I know social media can blow things out of proportion. Just because someone has a big following doesn't mean everything they say is balanced or up to date. Still, it makes me hesitate. I think I’ll message my doctor and ask directly about what Dr Miles said maybe even include a link to the video. Something like, “Hi, I came across this post saying Medex could have serious long-term effects on the liver. Is this something I should be worried about?”

I’ll also check the official health websites like the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) or even look up the medical articles Dr Miles flashed on screen, if I can find them. If the articles are real and recent, that might mean there's more to this than what my doctor first told me. I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now, at least until I’ve cleared this up properly.

C. determine if food critics were paid to go to the restaurant/leave a review or if they voluntarily went and left good reviews, see the google reviewers history (other ratings they have made)
D. check if any other resturant, with better ratings, is available, give friend b options and ask what they would prefer

B. ask my clinician what he thinks about the video and studies, ask why he did not tell me these potential risks, ask my family for their input on the risks to gather information on family history to find my susceptibility etc
C. double check the significance of the results of the studies the dr used to back up the claim in his video, double check if the images the dr showed were factual
D. research more into the supposed liver problems and the specific medication, find other research studies, maybe ones that find no risk / mild risks when taking the medication

Personally, I think it might have happened before, but not recently. Finally, my final decision is that if I confirm that there has been a poisoning incident recently, I will go to the merchant to discuss the matter and refund the fee for the reserved position. If no such event has occurred recently, I would choose to keep the reservation. Even if they don't come, I will still go and eat by myself.","First of all, I will feel extremely confused.

I will carefully read these comments and discuss with my doctor again whether to continue taking this drug or if there are other alternative drugs that can serve as substitutes.

So I'd probably tell him that if he wanted to change the booking he shouldve said something earlier and that me and friend B will be going to this place regardless of if A was coming or not.

I would also check in with Friend B first to make sure they can come. My final choice would depend on whether the reviews seem trustworthy and what the restaurant says when I call them. This is because I don't want to have wasted my money as it's not refundable but want to take my friend's text into consideration just in case it is true.",My immediate gut reaction would be shock and suspicion. I would immediately do more research on the GP's video and check out all his sources to see if they are reputable. I would also search for customer testimonies to see if anyone is experiencing major symptoms or discomfort after using the medicine. I would ask the clinician about the video I saw to see their opinion on it and also consult with friends and family. I would decide which information is trustworthy based on experience and expertise. My final decision would likely be to not take the medicine as there are surely other ones that would not have these side effects which work just as well and I'd rather not risk it.,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,5 = Extremely Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,158.0,122.0,15.86,9.82,4.66,3.19,42.57,43.46,8.44,11.8,19.75,20.33,16.46,19.67,94.94,94.26,75.32,72.13,60.76,61.48,15.19,14.75,9.49,9.02,6.96,6.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.82,2.53,1.64,5.7,5.74,10.76,11.48,5.7,4.1,0.63,0.0,13.289999999999996,11.48,12.03,13.11,6.96,7.38,12.03,11.48,2.53,2.46,21.52,20.49,6.33,4.92,1.9,1.64,4.43,4.1,3.16,2.46,0.63,1.64,0.63,0.82,32.91,33.61,0.63,0.82,22.78,26.23,3.16,4.92,4.43,4.1,6.96,6.56,4.43,4.92,0.0,0.82,5.7,7.38,0.0,0.0,2.53,4.1,0.63,1.64,1.9,2.46,1.27,1.64,0.0,0.0,1.27,1.64,0.0,0.0,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.92,9.02,8.23,3.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.63,0.0,0.63,0.82,6.96,2.46,5.7,5.74,0.0,0.82,2.53,0.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.82,1.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9,0.0,5.7,3.28,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.53,3.28,1.9,0.82,0.0,0.0,2.53,4.1,0.0,3.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.27,0.0,0.63,0.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.82,0.63,2.46,8.86,7.38,7.59,8.2,2.53,2.46,0.63,0.0,4.43,2.46,0.63,3.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.16,3.28,1.27,0.82,6.33,3.28,1.27,0.0,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.13,6.56,5.06,4.92,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.16,1.64,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,56

 I would be disappointed and displeased as I'm about to lose money when I first received A's message. I would then check the google review myself to see how recent the food poisoning occurred. If it happened within this week, I would suggest eating takeout at whoever's house, if not I would try to convince them to go. 
I would overall try to keep the situation light as its B's birthday and I do not want to cause any tension. So I will probably respond with a surprised emoji. 
Regarding A's lack of response a month prior I would no longer ask for their opinion and instead take full control of the situation. 
Overall, I will change plans for us, as I don't want my friend risk to get diarrhoea on their birthday. But because I don't want to waste money, I would check if I can change booking date and go by myself some other time.","At first I will be very concerned for my health and wellbeing. However I'm not bothered to look at journals and articles by myself, so I would stop taking Medex overall and switch to other medicine that have less debate around the side effect of the drug. I will also consult opinions from clinics and pharmacy. But then I know that nearly all medicine affect the liver and the data might not look at users interactions with other drugs which could also affect their liver health. 
It also depends on the duration that I'm required to take the drug, if it's short-termed, I would take it, if it's to treat chronic headache then I might go in for another consultation. 
If I have to decide, I will take the drug, because I trust my doctor.

Upon reading Friend A's message, my immediate gut - reaction is one of annoyance. I mean, where were they when I was struggling to find a restaurant on my own after they ghosted me? Now, just three hours before the dinner, they pop up with this alarming news.

Right away, I'd be tempted to text Friend A back saying, ""You went radio - silent on me when I needed help, and now you come up with this? How reliable are these Google Reviews anyway?"" I'm skeptical because I remember the restaurant has great reviews from professional food critics. Food critics usually have more in - depth knowledge and experience in evaluating restaurants compared to random diners on Google Reviews.

To decide which information is trustworthy, I'd consider the source. Food critics are likely to have visited the restaurant, tasted the food properly, and made a more objective assessment. On the other hand, Google Reviews can be subjective, and it's possible that those who claimed to get food poisoning had other factors contributing to their illness.

Before making a final decision, I'd do some extra checks. I'd try to find more recent reviews on other platforms like Yelp or TripAdvisor. I'd also look for any official health inspection reports of the restaurant. If I can't find any red flags from these additional sources, and considering that most nearby venues are full, I'd probably stick with the original booking. After all, I've already paid a non - refundable deposit, and the positive reviews from food critics give me some confidence in the restaurant's quality.","Watching Dr Miles' video first made me anxious—my doctor said Medex was safe, but this warning about liver risks felt alarming.

I’d message my doctor right away: “I saw Dr Miles’ video on Medex’s liver risks. Should I be worried? What do you think?”

To check credibility, I’d look at the studies Dr Miles cited—are they peer-reviewed? I’d also ask my doctor for their source of info.

I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now. Until I get clear answers from my doctor or more research, it feels safer to wait.

I wouldn't believe everything on social media, even if it were a doctor with a large following.

I couldn’t believe they waited until three hours before dinner to bring this up, especially after completely ignoring me when I asked for help weeks ago. If they were so concerned about food safety, why didn’t they say something earlier or better yet, book the restaurant themselves? I would reply right away with something like, “Seriously? You had one job, and you ghosted me when I needed help. Now that I’ve done everything, suddenly you care? If you’re so worried, feel free to find another place yourself. I’m not doing it again.” To be sure, I would contact the restaurant to check if there were any recent food safety complaints. I’d also look at the reviews carefully when were the food poisoning claims posted? Are they verified or just random angry customers? In the end, I would keep the booking. It’s too late to change anything, the deposit is non-refundable, and I already took responsibility when A didn’t. If they don’t want to come, that’s their choice but I’m done handling things for them.
","When I saw the video by Dr. Herbert Miles, I felt uncertain but not panicked. These days, many people on social media pretend to be doctors or spread false medical advice just to go viral. So I knew I had to stay calm and check the facts before reacting emotionally. I would message my prescribing doctor the next morning and ask clearly: “I saw a video saying Medex could harm the liver long-term. Can you help me understand if this is true?” I would also try to book appointments with one or two other doctors for second and third opinions. To decide who is trustworthy, I’d look for official qualifications, check whether Dr. Miles is a licensed GP, and see if the medical journal articles he shows are from peer-reviewed sources. If the journals are real but misquoted, that would change everything. Before making any decision, I want solid evidence. Only after speaking to professionals and reading real studies would I decide whether to take Medex. For now, I would pause taking the medicine until I feel confident that it is safe.

I would look into Dr Miles himself - where he practises, what other content he has posted online and his personal credibility. I would research these medical journals he cites and what they say, but also research other articles that support Medex as a safe drug. It is also prudent to look into what other doctors say and conclude about the drug. If I depend on the information stated without doing further research, I would not take the drug just to be on the safe side and look for alternative, more reliable drugs.

I chased them up, they ghosted me, and I ended up doing everything myself; finding the place, reading reviews, paying the deposit out of my own pocket. And it’s non-refundable too. I remember this place had a good write-up in that food magazine and most of the Google reviews were fine. There were a couple of bad ones, but seriously, every restaurant has a few horror stories. It doesn’t mean it’s a death trap.

Also, even if we wanted to change restaurants now, it’s a Saturday night. . I get being cautious, but this just feels like them trying to avoid responsibility again. Honestly, unless someone else wants to fork out hundreds of dollars for a new place and sort a backup plan within the next hour, we’re sticking to the original restaurant. I’m not throwing away the effort I put in or the money","Okay, that video really caught me off guard. I just got prescribed Medex today, and my doctor said it’s safe with only mild side effects. But now Dr. Herbert Miles, who seems credible and has a big following, is warning about serious long-term liver risks? And he even showed medical journal images to back it up. That’s pretty worrying. But then again, the comments are mixed, like some people say the data might be misrepresented, so maybe it’s not as clear-cut as he makes it seem.

I don’t want to ignore a potential risk, especially something serious like liver damage. But I also don’t want to panic over social media claims without solid proof.

My first course of action would be to message them, explaining my perspective of the restaurant having good ratings, as well as a non-refundable deposit. I would also explain that given Friend A's poor response time it was all I could find by myself on short notice. I would then go back over reviews of the place to find evidence supporting my claims around food critic's perspectives and send these to Friend A. I would also then look to see which reviews aligned with their perspective of giving food poisoning and take note of which dishes to potentially avoid to put Friend A's mind at ease. I would choose to keep the booking plans as Friend A should've been more proactive in finding places to book and communicating if they did not want to go to this restaurant.","I would be suspicious at first, taking information from an online video and would instead place more trust in my own doctor. However, I would look into the articles Dr Miles used to substantiate his claims and read them for myself and see how trustworthy they are, as well as looking into other medical journals to see how many concur these ideas. I would also contact my clinician with these concerns to see their perspective, and perhaps ask around if any friends have had experience taking the same medication.

B. I'd probably say something like ""ok, maybe we could ask the group what they think? Just a bit scared we won't be able to get a booking anywhere else this late...""
C. Food critic reviews seem more trustworthy, but also to me any reviews indicating food poisoning would plant a slight seed of doubt, that doesn't tend to be something people lie about. 
D. I'd probably read the reviews for myself and see if they seem truthful. 

I'd probably change the plans provided we could get a booking somewhere else, but if not wouldn't cancel as long as the groups okay with it.

","A. Immediate gut reaction would be confusion, maybe slightly scared that that information could be correct, and that i hadn't heard anything at all about liver effects from my doctor. 
B. Probably nothing - might potentially mention it to my doctor at my next appointment, but wouldn't actively try and contact them outside of that. 
C. I would definitely do some digging into that article about liver damage, and check if its from a trustworthy journal (peer reviewed etc) and maybe look into what the actual stats were in terms of people who had liver complications. 

Honeslty, I would probably end up ignoring the video - for 2 main reasons: 
1. even if it is correct and there is a chance of liver complications, if my doctor hasn't discussed it i'm sure that chance is incredibly small and not something worth worrying about especially if the medicine is proving effective in treating the headaches. 
2. I have no idea what the qualifications of some random dr online are, and would have to do some more research to look into the validity of the journal article. 

Even if initially i might be slightly scared that i could experience liver complications, i think looking into the stats would reassure me either that this wasn't the case or that it was a very small possibility, so in either case i would probably just proceed with my drs recommended course of treatment.

I trust my doctor, but the video was persuasive — especially the part where he showed journal article screenshots. It made me question whether I had been fully informed about Medex. I wouldn’t want to risk long-term liver damage just to treat my headaches.

Before jumping to conclusions, I’d message my doctor and say, “Hey, I came across a video claiming Medex can cause long-term liver issues — could we chat about it? Just want to make sure I’m making the right call.” I’d also look up the full articles Dr Miles referenced, not just the snippets shown in the video, to see if the data was taken out of context.

To figure out what’s trustworthy, I’d compare what peer-reviewed research says with guidance from official sources like the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) or health.gov.au. I’d also check whether Dr Miles has any conflicts of interest or a history of sensationalising health content online. If his claims hold up under scrutiny, I’d want to know — but if not, I won’t let fear-driven social media posts override medical advice from a qualified clinician who knows my history.

Ultimately, I’d delay taking Medex until I can speak with my doctor and verify the claims. It’s not worth the risk of blindly starting or stopping a drug based on a viral post, especially when the medical consensus might say otherwise.",2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,0,1.0,1.0,192.0,241.0,1.0,46.11,1.0,1.0,99.0,80.31,0.0,15.58,192.0,20.08,16.67,21.58,100.0,86.72,66.67,65.15,33.33,48.55,16.67,12.45,16.67,10.37,16.67,8.71,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.07,0.0,10.37,0.0,7.05,0.0,0.41,0.0,11.62,0.0,7.88,16.67,5.81,0.0,8.3,16.67,2.07,16.67,18.26,0.0,3.73,0.0,2.9,16.67,3.73,16.67,1.66,0.0,0.41,0.0,1.66,16.67,29.05,16.67,0.0,0.0,21.16,0.0,3.32,0.0,2.49,0.0,5.39,0.0,4.15,0.0,0.41,0.0,7.05,0.0,0.0,16.67,1.24,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.67,0.0,33.33,12.03,16.67,10.37,0.0,0.41,0.0,1.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41,16.67,6.64,16.67,1.66,0.0,0.0,16.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,1.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.24,0.0,3.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.9,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.81,0.0,4.56,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.24,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,1.24,16.67,3.73,16.67,9.96,0.0,2.49,0.0,0.83,0.0,4.15,16.67,2.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41,16.67,4.98,16.67,5.39,0.0,3.32,0.0,1.24,16.67,0.83,16.67,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.67,19.09,16.67,5.39,0.0,4.98,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.98,0.0,3.32,0.0,0.0,36

To my family I would say use more basic paracetamol or neurofen other than this new drug for a period of time. I would check the medication box and I will check the ingredients in it so that I'm not allergic or have drugs reactions with it. Then I will check side effects profile and efficacy profile.

I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit, and the place was reviewed well by actual food critics, not just random people on Google Reviews. I get that food poisoning is serious, but online reviews can be so hit-or-miss. One bad night and people go off, I need to be more objective.

I want to text Friend A something like, “Appreciate the concern, but I asked you weeks ago for input and didn’t hear back. It’s way too late to change plans now, especially since I paid a deposit and most restaurants are fully booked.”

","Wait, what? Now I’m supposed to worry about liver damage from Medex? That video is kind of unsettling, especially the medical images and Dr Miles' serious tone. But I also feel a bit skeptical it’s social media, and dramatic health warnings often get clicks. Still, I can’t ignore it completely, especially when it's about long-term effects.

I’d probably message my doctor something like, “Hey, I saw a video from Dr Herbert Miles about Medex and liver risks, have you heard anything about this? Should I be concerned?” I trust my doctor and would rather get clarity from someone who knows my specific case, not a general TikTok post.

To figure out what’s legit, I’d look up the articles Dr Miles mentioned, if I can find them. Are they from peer-reviewed journals? Are they recent or from obscure sources?

If we are not literally best friends, i'll be like whatever and handle it myself. Also depends on how much the deposit is, i'll be pretty sour and think negatively about friend A, however it's likely i'll keep this to myself as it is a non-issue in a grand perspective.

Then when friend A ask me about changing restaurant, i'll ask why they haven't contact me earlier and ask more proof about this food poisoning review, if they do have sufficient evidence, i'll ask them what is their plan. If they have a good plan, great, they own up to their mistake and i'll go with it, otherwise i'll call them on their actions.

It's likely i'll continue with what i'm doing, friend A is unreliable, a few google reviews can be misleading, and there isnt a lot of options remaining anyways.
","Depends on how Dr Miles deliver his video. If it is Mr Beast styled i will take it a lot less seriously. Regardless i'll probably just look at a few comments and go away to look at another video.

However, if the video really concerns me, i may inquire on my family and friends who had used medex before. First hand experience is better than whatever someone says online.

But if no one i know used medex before, i will inquire a pharmacist (not the doctor i got medex from, its likely he restates whatever he said before). If he supports the doctor, then there's 2 experienced GP vs 1 practice GP, i will take medex. If he supports Dr Miles instead, then i will seek alternatives

But it's likely that i will take the medicine anyways without inquire further, people online especially influencers are not reliable sources and will make things up for following

Hey, serious? It's only three hours until dinner now, and Friend A just sent a message about the issue of choosing a restaurant? I asked him to book a restaurant together a month ago, but he didn't reply to my messages at all at that time. In the end, I had to handle it all by myself and even paid a non-refundable deposit in advance. Now he just throws over a few screenshots of negative reviews and says, ""Maybe we don't need to go?"" It's really a big deal.

keep the booking
But if no serious situation is found after checking, I will definitely still follow the original plan. It's too hard to change places at the last minute now. All the other better places must be full, and Friend B will also be very unhappy. The overall reputation of this restaurant is quite good. A few negative reviews are not enough to directly deny it.

** Final decision ** : The original reservation is retained. I don't want everyone's mood to be disrupted, and I still trust this restaurant.","When I first saw Dr. Miles' video, my heart gave a jolt. I was a little scared. He spoke very convincingly, professionally and with pictures and evidence, which made me lose my confidence in Medex all of a sudden. Although it is an over-the-counter drug, he said it might have a long-term impact on the liver, and this is no joke. My first reaction was: Why didn't the doctor mention this to me? Is it that he doesn't know or doesn't take it seriously?
Final decision:  I won't start taking Medex for now until I confirm that it's really safe for me.

I replied to A and asked, “Where did you see this review? Is it recent? Just one person said they got food poisoning—was it serious?” I also checked Google Reviews myself. Most of them were very good. I even found some new reviews from this week that said the food was great.

To be safe, I called the restaurant and asked if they had any recent issues with food safety. They told me everything was fine, and no one else complained. That made me feel more confident.

Since I already paid a non-refundable deposit and there is no solid proof the restaurant is dangerous, I decided to stick with the plan. I trust the overall good reviews and the restaurant’s response. Changing now would be too late and too stressful.","When I saw the video by Dr. Miles, I felt nervous and confused. The idea of long-term liver damage sounded scary, especially since my doctor didn’t mention it. I started to wonder: Did my doctor miss something? Or is the video exaggerating?

I sent the video to my doctor and asked, “What do you think about this? Should I be worried?” I also talked to my older sister, who’s a pharmacist. She told me to look at the actual research articles, not just social media posts.

So I searched online and found one of the studies Dr. Miles showed. It did mention liver effects, but only in very rare cases with very high doses. I also found that Medex has been approved by medical authorities and used safely by many patients.

In the end, I decided to take the medicine, but I will follow the doctor’s instructions carefully and do a liver check-up after a month.

I feel a bit of panic too — what if the reviews are legit? I don’t want to risk getting anyone sick, especially not Friend B on their birthday. But also… I booked this place, I paid the deposit, and I remember reading solid reviews from food critics. I trusted those more than random one-star complaints.

I text Friend A back: “I appreciate the heads-up, but this is super last-minute. I read plenty of positive reviews, including critic ones. Did you find an alternative that isn’t fully booked?” I’m trying to stay civil, even though I’m seething.

To double-check, I Google the restaurant again and look at multiple review sites — not just Google, but also TripAdvisor and maybe even Reddit or any recent local food blogs. I also check the dates on the bad reviews: were they clustered together? From years ago? If there’s a legit pattern of recent food poisoning, I’ll consider switching.

If nothing looks alarming, I’m sticking with the booking. I won’t risk throwing the whole night into chaos based on one message three hours out. Worst case, I’ll give Friend B a heads-up when we get there and make sure everyone orders cautiously. But I’m not letting Friend A derail the whole plan without real evidence — especially when they bailed until now.","Oh no — seriously? I feel my stomach drop a little as I watch Dr Miles’ video. It’s not just someone ranting — he’s calm, he’s got credentials, and he’s citing journal articles. That part grabs me. My first instinct is confusion and a bit of anxiety. My doctor told me Medex was safe and had minimal side effects. I was ready to start it tonight… and now I’m wondering if I’ve missed something big.

I screenshot the video and send it to my GP with a short message: “Hey, I saw this online — any thoughts? Just want to double check before I start Medex.” I’m not trying to be disrespectful, but I also want to be sure. At the same time, I message a friend who’s a pharmacist and ask if they’ve heard anything about Medex and liver damage.

To sort out who to trust, I ask myself: What’s the source? My GP has seen my full medical history and prescribed Medex based on that. Dr Miles might be legit, but social media doesn’t give the full context. I try to find the actual journal articles mentioned in the video — if I can read the abstract or conclusion myself, I might see if the claims are overblown or cherry-picked.

Next, I check the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) site or any government health sources to see what they say about Medex’s side effects. If liver issues were a real risk, I’d expect it to be listed somewhere official, not just in a viral video.

In the end, I decide to hold off on taking Medex tonight — not because I’m convinced it’s dangerous, but because I want to clarify things first. I trust my doctor, but I also think it’s responsible to follow up when new information comes up. If my doctor reassures me and the evidence checks out, I’ll start it. But for now, I’d rather be cautious than uncertain.",3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,5 = Extremely Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,5 = Extremely Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,264.0,318.0,20.83,16.21,8.2,1.0,98.83,97.47,15.95,20.23,13.2,14.449999999999998,18.56,16.35,90.15,90.57,70.08,72.96,53.03,53.77,14.02,18.87,10.61,13.84,7.2,11.64,0.76,0.0,1.52,0.0,0.0,0.9399999999999998,1.14,0.63,3.41,5.03,10.98,10.69,6.44,5.66,1.52,0.63,9.85,9.75,6.82,10.38,10.23,4.09,9.47,9.75,3.03,1.89,14.39,20.13,6.82,7.550000000000001,6.06,3.46,6.06,2.83,3.79,0.9399999999999998,1.52,0.31,0.76,1.57,32.95,32.7,0.76,0.31,16.67,18.87,5.3,3.77,0.38,2.52,1.14,2.2,3.41,6.599999999999999,0.76,0.63,6.44,6.599999999999999,0.38,0.0,6.44,3.14,3.03,1.57,3.41,1.57,3.03,0.9399999999999998,0.38,0.31,2.65,0.63,0.76,0.31,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.85,9.75,3.03,6.92,0.76,0.0,0.0,0.63,0.38,0.31,0.0,0.31,1.52,3.77,6.82,2.83,0.0,0.0,1.89,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9399999999999998,1.52,1.26,0.38,0.31,0.0,0.0,1.14,0.9399999999999998,4.17,1.89,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.03,1.89,0.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.65,3.77,0.76,2.52,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38,0.9399999999999998,0.76,0.9399999999999998,0.0,0.0,0.76,0.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.14,1.26,0.0,1.26,9.09,6.599999999999999,8.33,9.12,1.89,1.26,0.0,0.63,4.92,5.03,1.14,1.89,0.0,0.31,0.38,0.63,7.950000000000001,4.4,4.17,4.09,5.3,6.599999999999999,2.65,1.89,1.14,1.26,1.14,0.9399999999999998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,21.21,20.75,6.06,6.599999999999999,5.3,5.03,2.27,0.9399999999999998,0.0,0.0,4.17,5.97,3.41,2.2,0.0,0.0,58

b. ""hey, yeah i see what you are saying, but i did extensivly check the reviews before booking and it looks like that was jsut a one-off thing. ive already booked this current place and my booking is non refundable. would it be ok if we just give this place a try think it could be really nice. if we get there and the vibes are off wecan change it up. 

c. im assuming that because i booked this so far in advance, i would have previously and carefully checked reviews. i would have also compared options. 

ultimately i would suggest we stick with the origional booking just to give it a go becuase most other places would be booked i had done the previous research and if we show up and have a bad feeling we can always change in that moment. no point disaster planning yet ","of the bat i am already hesitant towards taking any mediacation that messes with my body even if side effects are minor. 
the video would definetly instill doubt and make me nervous. i think the big quesion for me would be does the pain the medication relieve out way the harm it could cause. i would aslo consult with my doctor (or di my own idependant research) and ask about long-term risks and  alternative options. the fact that it is an over the counter drug however does make me a bit more doubtful of the online doctors claims. if this drug was so bad for us, why sell it over the counter?

My gut says to just try the restaurant because all the other restaurants are full and it's too late, and if the food is bad atleast there is memories from it. It's kind of upsetting that they didn't respond until 3 hours before the dinner. Very frustrating to have been put in this situation

B. Hey, sorry for booking the dinner but I think it might be too late to cancel/refund, because there is a non-refundable deposit and just because there is a few bad reviews doesn't mean its entirely bad, because I've seen some good reviews too. Maybe we can try out the good dishes they reccomend and if its absolutely ridiculous we can always go out again another time or go to another place

C. Both seem reasonable, but cross referencing which dishes, time thhe reviews were posted and authenticity of the food credits will also count. 

D. Hmm, discuss a little bit with friend B what they would want to do aswell cause realistically their birthday aswell.

Keep the booking, but be wary with what we choose, maybe avoiding the said  ""bad dishes"" and trying out the ""good ones"" and seeing if it's really reflecting the critics. ","A. I am really conflicted, because there is cases that both can be right or wrong, either and or, as well as it could depend on the person. Does it pose as long term risk for everyone of particular people with underlying conditions. Research on my own aswell

B. Ask supporting friends, family. Research more about it on google, qualified scholars and websites/articles. Asking different GPS, even the health websites.

C. Check supporting articles, personal experiences of different people and see if its underlying conditions that could increase the risk. 

D.  If there are any other ways to help with the headaches, other remedities. And if the recurring headaches could be due to lack of hydration, sleep, food, norusihment etc.


I would probbaly try different remedities, not fully trusting both sides but approaching it cautiously and also seeing if there are other reasons for my headaches, and other ways to fix it asides from medications",3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,206.0,156.0,22.1,41.98,26.87,5.47,65.99,30.98,7.25,28.82,18.73,12.0,16.99,25.0,91.26,83.33,72.33,62.18,55.83,51.92,12.14,8.33,4.85,2.56,1.46,2.56,1.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.94,0.0,7.28,5.77,14.08,12.82,7.77,3.85,0.49,0.0,7.77,11.54,10.68,7.69,8.25,5.77,10.19,12.18,0.97,0.64,19.42,12.82,5.34,8.97,6.31,2.56,3.4,4.49,1.94,2.56,1.46,1.28,0.0,0.64,34.47,26.92,0.97,0.64,21.36,21.15,4.37,0.64,3.4,1.92,3.4,4.49,4.85,5.13,1.46,1.28,5.83,10.9,0.49,0.0,6.31,3.21,2.43,1.92,3.88,1.28,4.37,0.0,1.46,0.0,2.91,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.74,8.33,4.37,3.21,0.49,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.64,2.43,1.28,4.37,5.13,0.0,0.64,0.49,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.92,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.92,4.85,2.56,0.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.43,2.56,1.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.85,5.13,0.0,3.85,0.0,1.92,0.0,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.37,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.64,0.49,0.64,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.97,1.28,0.0,1.28,8.74,3.85,8.25,5.13,0.49,0.64,1.94,0.64,5.34,2.56,1.46,1.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.85,2.56,3.4,0.0,5.83,3.85,0.97,0.64,1.46,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.02,16.67,5.34,7.69,4.85,8.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.91,0.0,2.91,0.64,0.0,0.0,58

Changing the plan is riskier: As dinner time approaches, nearby restaurants are likely to be fully occupied. Making a last-minute change might result in a worse experience (such as long queues, poor service). 
The loss of the deposit is not worthwhile: The non-refundable deposit has already been paid. If there is no conclusive evidence to prove that the restaurant has systematic safety issues, cancelling it is unreasonable.

I felt really annoyed because I had asked for their help a month ago and they ignored me. Now, just three hours before dinner, they suddenly bring this up.
Even though I was upset, I’d probably hold back and reply with something like, “Really? I remember seeing a lot of good reviews before,” just to stay calm on the surface.

Next, I would immediately check Google and other review platforms myself to see if there were more recent reports about food poisoning or if it was just one or two random bad reviews.
I’d also go back to see what the professional food critics said, since I remember this restaurant being highly rated.
If possible, I would message a friend who has been there recently and ask about their experience.
At the same time, I’d look to see if there’s any chance of finding another restaurant at short notice, though three hours before dinner is really tight.
If we really have to change, I would ask A and B to share the cost of the non-refundable deposit.

After thinking about it, I would keep the original booking.
The main reasons are that the majority of reviews are still positive, a single screenshot isn’t reliable, it’s too late to find another place, and I don’t want to waste the deposit I already paid.","When I first saw Dr. Miles’ video, my immediate reaction was surprise and worry: “Wait, is this true? Could this medicine really harm my liver?”
I felt a wave of doubt, because my doctor seemed so confident earlier today that Medex was safe and effective.

My first instinct is to send a message to my doctor: “I just saw a video saying Medex could harm the liver—should I be worried?” I’d probably also share it with a close friend and ask, “Have you heard anything like this before?”

Before making any decisions, I would try to figure out whether this information is reliable. Social media videos can be misleading, so I would look up the journal articles that Dr. Miles showed in the video to see if they were recent, well-respected studies or taken out of context. I might also check trusted medical websites or call a pharmacy for professional advice.

In the end, I would still choose to trust my doctor and start taking Medex, but I would keep monitoring and ask more questions at my next appointment. My decision is based on the fact that my doctor knows my personal health history, while a short social media video doesn’t tell the full scientific story.

R_9UhzOhoJjpcAbBV,2,2.0,2.0,4.0,74,"a. Reading his situation Friend A frustrated and irritated me in the sense that she had no contribution to group management but yet had something to say. However I also had the understanding that the sudden food poisoning alerts were out of her control and the timing of the situation was just unlucky. Her suggestion that they shouldn't go anymore was purely with the intention to avoid the risk of getting illness, which is completely understandable. However, I still feel frustrated because it would be invalidating for the friend who planned everything and put in a non-refundable deposit. 

b. I'd tell her I understand and try to communicate with her that I had already paid a non-refundable deposit and possibly that case of food poisoning could be an anomaly and one-time event. Especially since when restaurants are notified of potential risk, they would change their ways and be more cautious to prevent public criticism and  risk inducing a poor reputation. 

c. Depends on the quantity; for instance, if there were multiple Google reviews, I would be understanding. However, it is very common for restaurants to have incidents here and there all the time. And it depends on how recent the review was, etc. 

D. I'd call the restaurant to ask if they've implemented any risk management procedures and if they were aware of a food poisoning incident. 

I'd be open to looking for an alternative; however, it is purely dependent on circumstance. For instance, if there are  no bookings left, I'd go to my original plan, and if only one customer had reported food poisoning from a restaurant that is highly regarded by food critics, it probably is a restaurant that would most likely prevent further issues from occurring. 

 still go, restaurants venues are usually booked out at night and if this food poisoning was a one time ","a. ""I should get off this."" ""How much do I need this medication, and how effective is it in stopping my recurring headaches?"" ""Is there another alternative I can take?""  

b. I'd ask friends and family for advice; this situation would most likely make me anxious and concerned for my health. I'd also go back to my GP and ask if there is another alternative I can take.

c. If it is backed by empirical articles and multiple articles, then yes, it is accurate. 
 
d. I'd also do my own research into the medication from client reviews on youtube, Reddit, etc. 

I would probably get off my medication out of health anxiety fears.

It feels like they are being insincere too, since the restaurant has great reviews. Perhaps they simply don't like the choice - however, if they didn't, they should've brought it up with me prior. I would ask Friend A why they didn't bring it up with me earlier, as it's too late to cancel (including getting a deposit back). I would also ask if they have heard any negative things firsthand about the place. If not, I would explain my perspective and situation, and how I would want to keep the booking due to the investment of time and money I put in. I would choose in the end to keep the booking, but make it clear to Friend A that my choice is not because I don't trust their judgement, as I dislike hurting others' feelings through confrontation.","My immediate gut reaction would be to trust my own doctor, as they know my medical history the best (including reactions/side affects of medications with other meds I am on). I also generally do not trust social media medical advice, as advice varies on individual circumstances - another reason for choosing to take Medex. If I was concerned, I would do my own research on google, and perhaps go to the pharmacy or contact my doctor the next day with any questions. I may also check online to see if Dr Miles has reliable credentials, due to the mixed responses in his comments. I would overall trial Medex for a period of time, therefore trusting my doctor, and regularly test for liver function if I was highly concerned.

R_47BcUqTx8qqGiax,10,0.0,1.0,1.0,50,"When I received A’s message, my first reaction was frustration. I had asked for help a month ago, and A never responded—now they suddenly question the restaurant hours before the dinner? I felt a mix of anxiety and irritation, especially because I had already paid a non-refundable deposit.

Still, I tried to stay calm. I searched online for the same reviews A mentioned. I found one report of suspected food poisoning, but it wasn’t clear if it was the restaurant’s fault. I also noticed that the restaurant still had many recent positive reviews, especially from food critics. That made me question whether A’s concern was based on solid evidence or just panic.

I texted A and explained that I had already made the booking due to their silence, and changing the plan now would be difficult. I reassured them that I had looked into the reviews again and didn’t find convincing reasons to cancel.

In the end, I decided to stick with the original plan. The restaurant still seemed trustworthy, and it felt unfair to change everything last-minute after all the effort I made.
","When I watched Dr. Miles’s video, I felt instantly alarmed. The idea that Medex might cause serious liver damage was shocking, especially since my own doctor had told me it was safe with minimal side effects.

I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, so I decided to double-check. I searched for the article Miles had cited, and it was indeed real, but the study was based on a small sample and used much higher doses than what I had been prescribed. I also looked up responses from other medical professionals online—some agreed with Miles, but others argued he had exaggerated the risks.

To be safe, I called my doctor the next morning. She patiently explained that the liver concerns were extremely rare and mostly related to long-term overuse. She also offered to run regular liver function tests if I was worried.

In the end, I chose to take Medex, but more cautiously, under supervision. I valued my doctor’s clinical advice and appreciated her willingness to support me through regular checkups.

R_4G6rO6u8exqtpAV,2,2.0,0.0,2.0,57,"Wow. Seriously? Three hours before the dinner and now Friend A sends this? After ghosting me when I asked for help weeks ago? I’m honestly pretty pissed off. I’ve been stressing about this for a month, ended up booking it all myself, paid the non-refundable deposit — and suddenly they care? And about something they found on Google Reviews? It just feels a bit inconsiderate and honestly kind of cowardly to drop this so last minute.

My first instinct is to snap back like, “Where was this energy when I needed help a month ago?” But I know that’s not helpful right now. I’d probably reply with something more composed like: “I saw that review too, but it’s one of like hundreds and most of them are great. It’s a bit too late to change now, but if you're really worried, feel free to sit this one out.”

I’ll do a quick check anyway, just in case — scan the most recent reviews, see if that food poisoning comment is a one-off or part of a pattern. Maybe hop on the restaurant’s social media to see if they’ve posted anything weird recently. If anything seems seriously off, I’ll reconsider — but honestly, I trust the food critics more than some random angry Yelp user from two years ago.

I’m keeping the booking. It’s too late to change plans, and the place still seems solid overall. It’s not perfect, but this is Friend B’s birthday, and I’m not going to let one panicked message ruin it. If Friend A doesn’t want to come, that’s on them.
","Okay, wow… that video was kind of unsettling. My immediate gut reaction is anxiety — like, have I been misled? I trusted my doctor when they said Medex was safe, and now this GP online is saying there’s a serious risk to my liver? It makes me feel a bit betrayed, like maybe I didn’t ask enough questions at the appointment. But I also know that online videos can sometimes blow things out of proportion for clicks or attention.

I’d probably message my doctor — something like: “Hey, I came across a video by Dr Herbert Miles warning about liver damage from Medex. Is there truth to this? Should I be concerned?” I might also ask a pharmacist I trust or check in with a friend who’s studying medicine, just to get more perspectives.

As for figuring out what to trust — I’d want to look at the actual journal articles Dr Miles flashed in the video. Are they peer-reviewed? Recent? Are they large-scale human trials or obscure animal studies? And is Dr Miles interpreting them accurately, or cherry-picking scary data? I’d also check what reputable health bodies like the TGA (in Australia) or FDA (if this were the U.S.) have said about Medex. If they haven’t issued any serious warnings, that would give me some reassurance.

Before deciding, I’d look for any official responses to Dr Miles’ claims — maybe medical associations or other doctors have weighed in. If it still feels murky, I might ask for an alternative or delay starting the medication until I have clarity.

I’d hold off on starting Medex until I get a clearer answer from my doctor. My headaches are recurring, but not urgent enough to risk potential long-term liver damage — if that risk is real. I want confirmation from someone I trust medically, not just an influencer GP online, before putting something in my body regularly.

i cancel, look for another place and call my mate for approval. 

If the restaurant says no: 
if the booking price was cheap like $50 or under, i would just book another restaurant and lose the money whatever.

I’m honestly frustrated that Friend A is only getting back to me now, especially after ignoring my messages when I needed help planning.

I’d probably text her back something like: “Where was this info earlier? I already paid for the booking, and the place has great critic reviews. I’ll double-check, but this is really late to raise it.” I’d also want to fact-check those reviews myself. Are those claims about food poisoning just a few one-star reviews? Or is there a pattern?
I’d check the most recent Google and TripAdvisor reviews, maybe even the restaurant’s social media to see if they’ve posted anything or responded to complaints. If I can’t find solid proof of a problem, I’m inclined to go ahead.
So my final choice is to keep the booking. It’s too late to make other arrangements, and there’s no strong evidence the restaurant is unsafe. I’ll ask Friend A to decide whether she’s still comfortable coming, but I’m not cancelling on Friend B’s birthday.","Whoa, this is a bit unsettling. I was feeling pretty confident about starting Medex — my doctor seemed sure, and said the side effects were minimal. But now, this video from Dr Miles has thrown me off. Long-term liver risk? That’s a big deal.
I think I’d first message my GP and ask directly, something like “Hi, I just saw a video from a GP warning about Medex and liver damage, is this something I should be worried about?” I trust my doctor more than a social media post, but I still want to double-check.

However I would try and put this aside, and ask them whether there's a lot of other good reviews on the site of diners who didn't get food poisoning. I would also ask when the reviews were posted, as if they were recent then I would ask Friend B if they're ok with still going to the restaurant, or if they'd rather go somewhere else since it's their birthday. I would also tell Friend A that we've already paid a deposit, and if they're unsure then we can order food that has less chance of causing food poisoning. 

If the bad reviews are old or outnumbered, then I would keep the booking. If the reviews are recent or there is a significant amount of them, then I would consult with Friend B and probably change plans. ","Whilst I would immediately feel concerned upon reading the article, I know that a lot of information on social media is not fully trustworthy. I would go and read the medical journal articles by the GP and see if the data supports his claim or whether they have been misrepresented. I would then do additional research and see if other trustworthy medical information sites, e.g. medical journals, government websites,  have similar warnings to what the GP said, using search terms that both support and oppose the presence of severe side effects. If there is a chance that the GP's advice is true, then I would consult my doctor and a pharmacist about this risk and follow their advice. If they say that this risk is possible, then I would ask for an alternative prescription, otherwise I would continue the prescription if the risk is minimal.

I’m honestly kind of annoyed that they completely ghosted me when I asked for help weeks ago, and now they want to chime in last minute? That’s frustrating and feels pretty unfair. I already paid a non-refundable deposit, and now this?

I’d probably respond to Friend A with something like, “Hey, I get your concern, but I really wish you’d brought this up earlier. The booking is set and I already paid for it.” I’d try not to sound too angry, but I’d definitely be honest.

Final choice: I’d keep the booking. The timing is too last-minute to make new plans, the deposit is gone either way, and I trust the professional reviews more than a few bad anecdotes. Plus, Friend B deserves a smooth and enjoyable birthday and stressing about this hours before won’t help anyone.","I’d probably message my doctor first, saying something like: “Hi, I came across a video by Dr Miles warning about liver risks from Medex. Just wondering if this is something I should be worried about?” I might even send them the link and ask for clarification. I’d also ask a close friend or family member if they’ve ever used Medex or heard anything similar, just to see if this is a widely known concern.

To figure out who to trust, I’d want to look at the sources. Just because Dr Miles cites medical journals doesn’t mean he’s interpreting them correctly. I’d try to look up the articles myself or check if any official health organisations  have addressed these claims. I’d also check whether Dr Miles has a history of sensationalist posts or if he’s generally respected in the field.

Final decision: I’d hold off on starting Medex just for now and wait until I hear back from my doctor. It’s not worth jumping in while there’s uncertainty, but I wouldn’t dismiss the prescription entirely either, I just want more clarity before making a fully informed decision.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,1,1.0,1.0,152.0,186.0,17.38,16.19,12.65,1.7799999999999998,94.58,90.26,39.38,20.23,12.67,18.6,19.74,19.89,94.74,91.94,76.97,73.66,56.58,57.53,16.45,15.05,10.53,11.29,7.89,8.06,0.0,0.0,1.32,0.0,0.0,1.08,1.32,1.61,5.92,3.76,13.16,10.22,6.58,5.38,0.66,0.54,11.18,12.9,7.89,10.75,10.53,9.68,10.53,10.75,1.32,1.61,18.42,22.58,7.89,4.84,5.26,3.23,5.26,4.3,3.95,2.15,1.32,0.54,0.0,1.61,39.47,36.56,0.0,0.54,20.39,26.879999999999995,3.29,5.38,1.32,2.15,5.26,5.91,3.95,9.68,3.29,1.08,3.29,7.530000000000001,0.0,0.0,9.21,2.15,5.26,1.08,3.95,1.08,3.95,0.54,0.66,0.0,3.29,0.54,0.66,0.54,1.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.16,13.439999999999998,7.89,8.6,1.32,0.54,0.0,2.15,0.66,0.0,1.97,0.0,1.97,5.38,5.26,4.84,0.0,0.54,1.97,0.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.95,1.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.32,1.08,2.63,0.54,0.0,0.0,1.32,3.23,0.0,2.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.66,0.0,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.32,1.08,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.08,0.0,1.61,9.87,5.91,6.58,11.29,0.0,3.23,1.97,1.08,2.63,5.38,0.0,2.15,0.66,1.08,1.32,0.0,13.16,4.84,5.92,3.76,5.92,4.84,1.97,0.54,1.32,0.0,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.66,0.0,0.0,0.0,23.68,17.74,6.58,4.84,5.92,3.23,2.63,0.54,0.0,0.0,5.26,6.99,3.29,2.15,0.0,0.0,56

Hence, it feels as if there are ulterior motives; she possibly wanted to act as a hero and 'outshine' me, to make a more favourable impression on Friend B. A lot of places do have bad reviews, and it's easy to avoid certain meals if you're paranoid. It isn't fair to discredit critics and a restaurant by only trusting a few Google reviews. If it was such an issue, she could have researched it prior before I booked and made more of an effort to find a place that she was also satisfied with. I could have made more efforts to read the reviews; however, I did see the critic reviews, which should suffice. I will keep the booking, as if there was an issue, she could have brought it up to me earlier rather than last minute. ","My immediate reaction would be confusion.

I would tell them that it's non-refundable and we would have to attend as it's inconsiderate to change plans right before the event. 

I would offer an ultimatum, if friend A is able to find an alternative restaurant and pay their share (the full fee) of the booking, we could consult with friend B and find an alternative place instead. The chances of that it unlikely though as it's hard to negotiate and find alternative time and place again. 

In regards to the restaurants review, if the OVERALL impression of the restaurant is good then it's best to attend it either way. The likely hood of food poisoning is rare and it applies for EVERY restaurant. 

Personally, I would've stuck with the same booking if the Friend A isn't willing to pay for the full fee on the alternative restaurant.

I myself don't view social media as a reliable source of information (especially medical information) regardless of the following.
Up front (in-person) consultation with a certified doctor is my only reliable source, i can discuss with them about the consequences and bad influences of this medication which I've heard from social media. Rather than leaving those worries unattended, I can discuss with a doctor for them to give better clarification. 

Most of the time, social media is used to express the extremities of certain scenarios for entertainment, it's best to have it clarified with a professional in person.

I would probably also just do a google search of the medicines name and see what comes up online, however be careful to just read the infomation to help gain a balanced perspective or any questions when speaking to an actual professional.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,0,1.0,1.0,170.0,150.0,15.409999999999998,25.29,4.77,1.0,12.439999999999998,79.53,3.2899999999999996,13.14,24.290000000000003,25.0,15.29,20.67,94.71,94.0,75.29,76.67,60.0,60.67,13.53,10.67,8.24,6.67,6.469999999999999,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.76,0.67,5.29,4.0,11.76,13.33,8.82,9.33,0.59,2.0,8.24,8.67,14.71,12.0,7.0600000000000005,8.67,10.0,10.67,1.76,1.33,23.53,20.0,6.469999999999999,8.67,0.59,2.67,3.53,4.0,3.53,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,34.71,28.0,0.59,0.0,25.879999999999995,23.33,2.35,5.33,2.94,0.0,8.82,4.67,6.469999999999999,7.33,1.76,0.67,7.0600000000000005,9.33,0.0,0.0,9.41,2.0,3.53,0.67,5.88,1.33,5.29,0.67,0.59,0.0,4.71,0.67,0.59,0.0,1.76,0.0,1.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.35,8.0,6.469999999999999,6.67,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.0,0.59,0.67,4.71,4.0,5.88,1.33,0.0,0.0,3.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.33,2.35,3.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.18,3.33,1.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.18,4.0,0.0,3.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.18,0.0,1.18,0.0,0.0,0.67,1.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.67,0.0,0.0,10.59,7.33,3.53,8.67,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.33,2.35,4.0,0.59,2.67,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.0,2.35,1.33,7.65,0.67,0.59,3.33,0.59,0.0,1.76,0.0,1.18,0.0,0.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.18,9.33,4.12,4.0,4.12,2.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.35,0.67,0.59,2.0,0.0,0.0,62

I think I would have to step back for a second before replying to make sure I didn’t say anything I would regret. Considering how late it is, I would guess that the deposit would be lost by this point, and therefore I would be losing that money if we didn’t go to the restaurant. It’s difficult to say whether or not the food critics or the google reviews are more trustworthy, so I think I would ignore the reviews entirely considering it’s so last minute. Ultimately, I think I would tell Friend A that we should keep the booking. I would tell them that if they wanted to have a look around for another restaurant then they were more than welcome, but they would have to help me pay for the deposit for the other restaurant. At the end of the day its most important that Friend B enjoys their birthday, but I would make it clear that I should not be paying for the last minute change of plans alone. If Friend A did not want to pay for the deposit, I would reiterate that we should then keep the booking.","I would immediately be concerned about the conflicting opinions. I don’t think listening to the comments is helpful, so I probably wouldn’t read too far into them or let them dictate what I do. I would probably go to a pharmacy and let them know about my concerns and use that as a second opinion. If the pharmacist or doctor there agreed with my doctor, I would probably go on to ask friends and family if they had any personal experiences with the drug. If they had, I would trust their opinions and get an idea of what the general consensus is. I think I would ultimately approach my doctor as a final step and express my concerns to them before deciding what to do. I would want my doctor to reassure me about the validity of Dr Miles’ claims and the suitability of the articles he references.

scenario a (hefty deposit): if she is kind enough to take on some of deposit then i would be happy to switch restaurants if there was one to her liking, otherwise i would snitch to any other friends involved/invited and probably keep the booking out of spite. 

scenario b (smaller deposit): i would be a kind gracious friend and start looking for restaurants with less health risks, hopefully find one and switch the booking","i would feel rather shocked and betrayed and immediately contact my clinician about these side effects. i would additionally try to do my own research into these medical journal articles and gauge at the reliability of the articles. i would also ask around to see if any of my family and friends have tried the medication before in attempt to gather any first hand information. i would consider the information from my clinician, the articles as well as friends/family before making a decision",2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,0,1.0,1.0,176.0,84.0,19.63,56.86,19.76,12.55,2.02,64.98,14.06,20.23,35.2,21.0,24.430000000000003,27.380000000000003,90.34,90.48,73.86,69.05,60.8,59.52,13.640000000000002,11.9,10.23,9.52,5.11,9.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.98,0.0,1.14,0.0,3.4100000000000006,2.38,13.07,17.86,5.68,7.14,1.14,1.19,10.23,17.86,12.5,7.14,7.39,8.33,8.52,11.9,1.7,0.0,20.45,15.48,5.68,2.38,5.11,1.19,3.98,8.33,2.84,4.76,0.0,2.38,1.14,1.19,27.269999999999996,26.19,0.0,0.0,20.45,20.24,2.84,7.14,3.4100000000000006,2.38,5.68,5.95,4.55,4.76,1.7,0.0,4.55,1.19,0.0,0.0,7.39,3.57,3.4100000000000006,1.19,3.98,1.19,3.98,1.19,1.14,0.0,2.84,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.7,0.0,1.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.07,7.14,5.68,2.38,1.14,0.0,0.57,0.0,1.14,1.19,1.14,1.19,2.27,1.19,7.39,4.76,0.0,2.38,2.27,2.38,3.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.25,1.19,1.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.14,1.19,3.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.84,5.95,1.14,4.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.14,0.0,0.57,1.19,0.0,0.0,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.57,0.0,1.7,1.19,5.68,8.33,3.4100000000000006,7.14,1.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.14,4.76,1.14,1.19,0.0,0.0,0.57,1.19,2.84,3.57,3.4100000000000006,1.19,2.27,1.19,1.7,0.0,1.14,0.0,1.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.93,5.95,2.27,3.57,3.4100000000000006,1.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.57,0.0,5.68,1.19,0.0,0.0,62

First I'd ask him why he didn't respond to my texts initially, and I'd want a decent reason for that. I'd tell Friend A that we'd better go regardless of reviews as I've already paid and it's non-refundable. If he still doesn't want to show up, I'd ask him to pay me back half the amount. Deciding which information is trustworthy and which checks/actions to take is a little more difficult. I'd need to see whether the poisoning incidents were isolated to a certain period, whether or not the restaurant had responded to them, and I'd figure out which dishes the victims ordered and make a note not to get them myself. I'd also need to look at when the critic reviews were posted and the content within them, which dishes they rate highly etc. I'd tell Friend A that we could order based on this information.","The immediate reaction is concern. If there are reports of Medex being harmful to people and it has been prescribed to me, I'd need to know whatever I could about the drug and its potential effects on the body. I'd let my clinician know about the social media post but I wouldn't immediately agree or disagree with its views. I would only message friends and family after I'm sure that Medex is harmful, if not then there's no reason to let them know. To decide which information is trustworthy I'd determine the veracity of the information Dr Miles relies on by checking whether it comes from credible health institutions, and whether sources like NSW share the same view on Medex. Social media is inherently unreliable, but the information could be true as long as the sources are dependable.

Validity would be checked by the amount of reviews these individuals have given, how long ago these reviews were put and what other reviewers have said on google reviews. Following this, I would make a subjective decision whether the claims are valid right now. I would also check the reviews that have been given on other platforms, such as tripadvisor. 

If there is a pattern of a specific food giving food poisoning, then I would say to Friend A that we will just avoid that meal and order something else from there. 

If Friend A is still insisting on not having that restaurant, then I would tell them that the booking has already been made, and a deposit has been given. If they are willing to get a booking and take responsibility for finding another restaurant, then I am happy to change plans, else we will keep this booking.","Immediately I would be shocked, because the patient-doctor relationship is built on trust, and if the doctor is not informing me of all the risks, then it undermines the belief in the healthcare system. 

I would then read into these medical journals that have been cited, investigating if what Dr Miles has said is true or if it is being exaggerated. I would also ask some known people who practice medicine of their opinion before making my own opinion of if the risks are valid. If I make the conclusion they are, then I would make another appointment with my doctor to inform them of my concerns. It is possible that the doctor did not know of the long-term risks of the medicine before prescribing it.

Frustrated by why the person completely ignored my texts when I asked for help booking, and now they suddenly swoop in with screenshots warning about food poisoning. Would also want to mention that they could’ve mentioned this when I was organising everything. 

B. Looking closer, the screenshots are just from random Google users. I know how unreliable those can be and there are chance that this might not even be related to the restaurant. 

C. I remind myself the restaurant has been praised by food critics, which holds much more weight. Still, I want to be sure, so I would check other platforms. 

D. No i wouldnt change my plan, just because some reviews were bad doesn't mean it will happen to everyone and plus at this point, changing plans would be chaos. Most nearby places are fully booked, the deposit is non-refundable, and there’s no convincing evidence this restaurant is unsafe. 
My decision: keep the booking. I’ll reassure Friend A and Friend B, explain the critic reviews, and move forward because one or two dodgy reviews aren’t enough to ruin Friend B’s birthday dinner.








","A. My gut feeling would be worry and frustration. Watching the video would have left me unsettled, almost with a sinking feeling and did my doctor miss something important about Medex? I’d also feel annoyed, wondering why my doctor didn’t bring up any serious risks if they exist.

B. I would probably message my doctor straight away if its true and I might also bring it up in the family group chat to see if anyone else has heard of this.

C. I know videos like this can go viral even if the claims aren’t fully accurate. 
D. I wouldn’t take the medication right away. The headaches aren’t urgent, and I’d rather be 100% sure before starting something that might have risks.

My decision: I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now and speak to my doctor tomorrow. I want to make the safest choice with the best information before I start the medication.

Like, where were you a month ago when I actually NEEDED your help? I had to find this place by myself, put down my own money for the deposit, and now you're trying to sabotage it last minute with some random Google reviews?
My first instinct is to text back something sarcastic like ""Thanks for the 11th hour input"" but I need to think this through for Friend B's sake.
Okay, let me look at these screenshots properly. Google Reviews can be unreliable - anyone can post anything. These could be fake reviews or just people having bad experiences that aren't representative. The food critics I read had actual credentials and probably more rigorous standards.
I'm going to quickly check if these reviews show up on other platforms like Yelp too. If there's a genuine food safety issue, it would probably appear across multiple sites, right? I should also see if these are recent reviews.
But honestly, what are my realistic options here? It's three hours before dinner - most decent places will be booked solid for weekend service. And I'd lose my deposit.  I am keeping the booking.
","Ugh, this is stressful. My first reaction is panic - liver damage sounds terrifying. But then I remember how much medical misinformation gets spread on social media, even by people with credentials.
I need to think about this rationally. Dr. Miles might be a real GP, but having a ""large online following"" doesn't make him more credible than my prescribing doctor. Social media incentivises dramatic content that gets engagement. The fact that he's ""warning"" about risks that patients ""aren't informed about"" sounds like typical fear-mongering language.
The mixed comments are telling - if other medical professionals are saying the data is misrepresented, that's a red flag. I should look up these journal articles myself rather than trust his interpretation. Are they recent? High-quality studies? Is he showing the full context or just cherry-picked excerpts?
My prescribing doctor would have access to comprehensive safety data and prescribing guidelines. They're also accountable to medical boards, unlike social media influencers. I'll ring their surgery tomorrow to discuss liver risks specifically, but I'm not going to panic based on one viral video.
Final decision: Start taking Medex as prescribed. My doctor's evidence-based recommendation outweighs a social media video, but I'll follow up to discuss any concerns directly with them.

It is nice that they want tohelp but frankly this timing is just undermining the original plan, showing little trust in my planning and the persons actions are not supportive as they didnt provide an alternative option. I would respect the input a bit more if it seemed like they were genuinely trying to help and provideconstructive feedback not doubt. I would tell them that iu appreciate their concern and hear them however i did do my own research and have seen lots of positive feedback from trusted food critiques, i would essentially try to reassure them of my choice and suggest that we just give the place a try and if we really catch a bad vibe we can pivot then, especially given the timing. I would trust my research as i am sure i would have looked into many places and chosen the one i trust and think looks best. ",Of the bat i would start to feel doubtful of my prescription and would be less inclined to take the medication. Moving forward i would do my own research and raise these concerns with my doctor. I do however notice a couple of red flag in the online doctors claim. For one being an over the counter drug would have to mean it isnt that intense and the mixed reviews underneath the video.

I would say to friend A 'you shiuld have been more involved and your laziness has affected the decision making, it should'nt be solely up to me'. I am trusting the numerous reviews saying the restaurant is good rather than 1 instance of food poisoning, this is not cause for concern yet. Google reviews are not always truthful anyway. I would look at the reviews myself and see if they are legitimate and also look at when they were written, this could be old information that has since become a non-issue. I decide to keep the booking, there is not enough cause for concern, i have paid a deposit, and there is not enough time to find a new location. If the food is off we can leave and improvise a new plan. ","I am worried that there is scientific information saying that the medication i have been prescribed could be harmful. Is my doctor lazily giving out medication or do they truly believe it is safe for me to take?. I would look at the journal articles myself, discerning whether the tests and authors were reliable. If people online say data is being misrepresented by Dr Herbert Miles, i would look at it myself, maybe the risks don't apply to my age group or physical condition. The research needs to be peer reviewed, and maybe a study has been done into the effectiveness of the medicine and low risk for liver health. I would get a second opinion from an in-person medical professional before continuing. Their response and my individual research would grealty sway my final decision.

R_9D0H2cidGGIgHTk,5,2.0,3.0,5.0,53,"When I first saw Friend A’s message, I felt frustrated and anxious. After all, they ignored my messages when I asked for help, and now, just three hours before dinner, they suddenly raise concerns. My immediate thought was, “Why now?” especially after I already paid a non-refundable deposit.

I would probably respond by saying, “I understand your concern, but I wish you had brought this up earlier. We’re very close to the dinner time, and it’s too late to make major changes.”

To decide whether to trust the reviews, I’d compare the dates of the negative and positive reviews. If the food poisoning claims are recent and repeated, that’s a red flag. But if they’re old or seem exaggerated, I’d trust the food critics and my original decision.

As an extra step, I might call the restaurant to ask if they’ve had recent complaints or check social media for any mentions.

In the end, I’d likely keep the booking. The restaurant has great reviews from reliable sources, and changing plans now would be too risky and stressful, especially since most other places are fully booked.","Watching Dr. Miles’ video made me uneasy—my doctor said Medex was safe, but now I’m hearing about liver risks. I trust my doctor, but the journal images in the video seem convincing. I’d message my clinician: “Is there any truth to these claims about Medex?” I’d also check reputable medical sites for balanced info.  

Since comments on the video are mixed, I won’t panic. I’ll wait for my doctor’s response and maybe research the studies Dr. Miles cited. If my headaches stay mild, I’ll delay taking Medex until I’m sure.

Even before that id probably search it up on google as well and just any other way to keep making sure but overall in terms of trust id probably trust the doctor but also I think who exactly my doctor is matters as well.

If it’s just a few bad reviews and the experts say it’s good, I think it’s fine.So finally, I decide to keep the booking. Too late to change plans, and I don’t see real proof that it’s dangerous.

I’d probably message a close friend or family member and say, “Hey, have you heard anything bad about Medex? Just saw this video and now I’m second-guessing what the doctor said.” I might even screenshot the video and send it to them for their opinion.

I don’t fully trust a social media post, even if it’s from a doctor especially if it’s gone viral. But I also don’t want to ignore it. I’d try to look up the articles Dr Miles cited to see if they really support what he’s claiming, and maybe check Medex on the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) website or Healthdirect. I’d also call or message my doctor and say, “I saw this video warning about liver risks with Medex can we talk about whether this is a real concern?”

Ultimately, I’d hold off on taking Medex until I’ve spoken to my GP again. I still value their professional opinion, but I want to be better informed.

Regardless, i would listen to their worries about food poisoning and do some quick research on the reviews. What the customers who got food poisoning ordered so maybe we could avoid ordering the same. The frequency of food poisoning reviews and check reviews from other websites other than google to see if it's the same.
That would help in the accuracy of the overall review of the restaurant, to see which is trustworthy.
Overall, i would still stick with keeping the booking. I have paid for the deposit and i trust in my own research pointing the restaurant to be good. I am not someone who would cancel hours before.","i would definitely be wary and on guard. initially, I'd continue to read the comment's perspectives and get the packaging of the Medex to check the information for myself with the side effects. Next, I'd skim over Dr Miles other videos and the comments to see if the comments change in agreeing or disagreeing. Then I'd search the web on Medex generally, for both reviews and information.
If the long-term side effects do pop up more, i might stop taking Medex. Recurring headaches is a common problem that doesn't require specific medication. Therefore, there should be plenty of alternatives to change to. I'd have a finial discussion with the GP for his own perspective but would request changing medication regardless.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1,1.0,1.0,215.0,120.0,46.62,75.4,7.47,2.26,53.52,91.92,15.07,11.69,16.54,15.0,23.26,25.83,95.81,89.17,69.3,62.5,57.21,54.17,14.88,7.5,10.23,6.67,5.12,5.83,0.93,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,3.26,0.0,4.65,0.83,13.02,14.17,8.37,10.0,0.47,0.0,14.420000000000002,14.17,10.7,11.67,5.12,4.17,7.44,7.5,2.33,0.83,17.21,15.0,5.58,5.0,1.4,3.33,5.12,2.5,3.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.86,2.5,31.63,30.0,0.0,0.0,21.4,24.17,3.26,6.67,1.4,4.17,5.12,5.83,2.79,4.17,0.0,0.83,7.44,5.83,0.0,0.0,6.05,2.5,2.79,0.83,3.26,1.6699999999999997,1.4,0.0,0.47,0.0,0.93,0.0,0.47,0.0,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.49,4.17,7.44,3.33,1.4,0.0,0.0,1.6699999999999997,0.0,0.83,0.93,0.0,4.19,0.83,6.05,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.93,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.83,9.3,0.83,1.86,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.65,0.83,3.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.05,2.5,1.86,2.5,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.47,1.6699999999999997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.83,0.93,0.0,4.65,5.0,6.51,9.17,3.26,2.5,0.47,0.0,1.86,5.83,1.4,0.83,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.58,8.33,4.65,0.0,2.79,1.6699999999999997,0.47,0.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.63,16.67,6.05,6.67,2.33,4.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.26,5.0,0.0,0.83,0.0,0.0,54
R_4LUM6rz4IyYO7mN,10,4.0,5.0,9.0,53,"When Friend A suddenly texts me three hours before the dinner with screenshots of food poisoning reviews, my first reaction is frustration—why didn’t they help research earlier? I remind myself to stay calm and assess the situation. I compare the few negative Google reviews to the restaurant’s overall high ratings and professional critic endorsements, realizing isolated incidents don’t define the place. A quick check confirms most complaints are outdated or vague, while recent diners praise the food. Since canceling would mean losing the deposit and scrambling for a last-minute alternative, I decide to keep the booking. I’ll advise the group to avoid high-risk dishes and trust my initial research. If anything, Friend A owes me an explanation for disappearing—but for now, the birthday celebration goes on as planned. ","At first, I feel uneasy watching Dr. Miles’ warning—my doctor said Medex was safe, but now this viral video claims serious liver risks. I pause and take a breath, reminding myself that sensational claims often spread faster than balanced facts. My instinct is to message my doctor: *""I just saw concerns about Medex’s liver effects—should I be worried?""* while also searching reputable medical sites to verify Dr. Miles’ claims. I notice his cited studies are real but involve extreme long-term use in high-risk patients, unlike my occasional dosage. The FDA’s website lists no liver warnings, and my doctor replies that the risk is minimal for my prescribed short-term use. After comparing both sides, I decide to trust my doctor’s guidance but will monitor for symptoms and avoid prolonged use. For now, I’ll take Medex as directed—but I’ll stay alert for new data.

I would also feel a bit angry as I was the one helping plan the outing a month ago, with friend B being unresponsive then and suddenly very responsive now about their opinions about the restaurant booking.

B, I would text back in a calm but logical manner saying that their opinions are slightly last minute and that I have already paid a deposit for the booking. I would also tell them that the 'food poisoning' incident could have been a one off thing, or some random customers writing false reviews. 

C, I would trust the information of food critics, knowing the fact that they review restaurants as a career, and thus have creditable titles. 

D, Before we make a final decision, I would do a google search myself, about the reviews for the restaurant, and if the most recent reviews are rated on the higher side, I would text the friend and tell them this information. If it turned out that Friend A was right, where a bulk of the recent reviews for the restaurant were about food poisoning, then I would either just tank the deposit, or ask that friend to split the deposit (seeing that they were unresponsive about the celebrations a month ago, and that they still have some responsibility over the planning) - I would also do some quick searches for other restaurants. 

Overall, I would keep the booking, seeing that other nearby venues are full and it would be too last minute to change anything. 
","A, Initially I would be a bit slightly cautious about the drug, however since I was prescribed the drug by the doctor, I would still consider taking it, especially since not all things on social media can be trusted. 
B, I might tell my friends about the slightly suspicious drug and ask them for advice on whether to take it or not, but other than that, I don't think I would be suspicious enough to trust a random GP on the internet over my actual physical GP. 
C, I think that my gut tells me to follow my actual GP over the GP on the internet, as although Dr Miles says that the drug would pose long term risk to liver health, there may be missing details on what exactly causes this risk such as the dosage or the frequency of taking the drug. Also, although he showed images of medical journal articles, it is easy to find academic or trustworthy looking journals on the internet that support any argument. 
D, I would probably do some quick checks by doing a search on the internet or maybe some forums about the drug, to see if the claims by Dr Miles are true. Also I think that I might look to see if any of the people in my inner circle have tried the drugs and experienced any symptoms. 

Ultimately, I think that if i was really really worried, I would get a second opinion by a different GP or ask the same GP about these claims.

After I asked and got a silent response, and finally I had to make the decision all by myself after a month?"" I might have felt frustrated and doubtful. I might have said to A, but now there are only three hours left. If we need to look for a new restaurant now, we might not be able to find a suitable one. And did many people say that in your comment? Or was it just an exception? If it was an exception, it might be caused by reasons such as competitors or guests having poor digestion, etc. Or we could also check on the local health bureau government platform to see if there are any public information about this restaurant. This should be relatively authoritative information. And I heard that the food critics of this restaurant have very high ratings. If we can't confirm that we can't find a suitable restaurant, perhaps we could also try this restaurant. Finally, because of these official information, multiple comments from various sources, the costs we have already paid and that are irrecoverable, I decided to keep the reservation.","The first thing that would come to my mind is ""Medex? Could it cause liver damage? This seems to be what a practicing general practitioner with quite a following said. Is it true?

I will also leave a message to my doctor saying ""I saw a practicing general practitioner say that this medicine Medex can damage the liver. Is this true?"" 。 To determine whether this information is true and reliable, one might check whether these journal papers have been published in authoritative journals in the relevant field, such as The Lancet, or to look at the official information regarding this drug. Eventually, I will choose to take the medication after consulting a doctor, because the journal papers mentioned by this blogger have been questioned and their data have been distorted. Moreover, my doctor is aware of my past medical history, but this blogger merely pointed out the potential widespread harm of this drug.

I would still base our decisions on reviews as I feel like they are more trust worthy than food critics. After seeing the reviews, based on what I said, I would make a decision.

Then I would tell my GP about the video by Dr Herbert Miles to see what he says, including about his journal article claims. If my GP is certain that the information is false and that I can take the prescription, I would do my own research based on validity Mr Herbert as a Doctor, and briefly read the journal articles. If I find evidence that he's not very well credited and valid, and the journal articles are misrepresented I would take the prescription. However, if I find out that theres a slight real chance that what he is saying is true I would just not take the evidence. I would also consult this with my mother and see what she says, if she says to just not risk it, I might just as my GP if there is another medication I can take. My final decision would be based on what I said, but I think most likely I would just ask my GP if there is any alternative options as I am not bothered to risk anything, if there is no other options for my headache I might just take the prescription and pray on it.

I'd feel as though they thought their judgement was better than mine and I'd be slightly panicked as well because of the lack of time to find a place everyone would enjoy.

B. I'd probably let their response sit for a while after I'd seen it as a way to channel my anger about their lack of response. Then I would text back something along the lines of ""If you can find a better restaurant to go to, I'm down otherwise we are going to x restaurant in 3 hours"". I'd also attatch screenshots of the critic reviews I saw.

C. I would look at overall ratings and also the extreme 5 star and 1 star reviews to see if anything seemed off about them. I'd also check multiple websites and potentially Tiktoks.

D. I'd consider what the birthday person likes and if their preferences are closer to mine or friend A's before I make my final decision.

I would keep the booking as there doesn't seem to be enough time to make new plans that would be equally well organised. I would perhaps suggest friend A to choose a dessert place in case the restaurant was bad to make sure the night ends well and both of us had input in the planning.","A. My heart would drop. I would be very panicked and immediately start scouring the internet for more opinions.

B. I would first call/ talk to my mum and mention all the information to her, asking for her opinion, my concerns and what I should do next. I would also book an appointment with my GP,  ASAP. I'd bring up the research I found, if there's any reason those wouldn't apply to me. I'd also rant to my friends but mostly as an emotional outlet than looking for serious advice.

C. I'd stop taking the medication while I waited to decide (if healthy). In this case, the risks outweigh the benefits too much for me to gamble on whether the video is correct or not unless other research proves it incorrect or irrelevant to me in a definite manner.

D. I would try to find similar medication with less risks and see if that's effective. I'd also go to another doctor for a second opinion and bring up my hesitations and worries.

My final decision would be to stop using the medication regularly for my headaches and reserving it for if it's ever really bad, at least until more research comes out.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,0,1.0,1.0,239.0,202.0,32.38,30.55,14.21,1.0,79.17,96.63,52.56,2.9200000000000004,15.93,13.47,17.99,19.31,92.47,92.57,74.9,73.27,59.83,61.88,15.06,15.84,12.13,11.88,7.95,10.89,0.84,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.99,2.9299999999999997,0.0,2.9299999999999997,3.96,10.88,17.82,7.109999999999999,6.44,1.26,0.99,15.9,14.36,11.72,9.9,6.69,5.45,10.88,11.88,1.26,0.99,22.18,16.34,4.18,7.92,2.09,4.46,3.77,1.49,1.67,0.99,1.67,0.5,0.42,0.0,30.96,31.19,0.84,0.99,22.18,22.77,6.69,4.95,2.09,0.99,7.95,5.94,4.6,4.46,0.0,1.49,3.77,6.93,0.0,0.0,7.109999999999999,4.95,4.6,0.99,2.51,3.47,2.51,1.98,0.42,0.0,2.09,1.49,0.42,0.99,0.84,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.21,5.94,2.9299999999999997,3.96,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.5,0.42,0.0,2.09,2.97,6.28,1.98,0.0,0.5,0.84,0.5,0.0,1.49,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.5,2.51,2.97,1.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.26,2.48,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,1.67,3.47,0.0,2.97,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.84,0.0,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.98,0.0,3.96,9.21,5.45,10.88,6.93,1.67,0.99,0.42,2.48,6.28,3.96,2.09,1.49,0.0,0.0,0.42,0.0,5.44,5.94,3.35,0.99,3.35,3.47,2.9299999999999997,0.0,0.42,0.5,0.42,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.13,15.84,6.28,7.43,0.42,2.97,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.6,3.96,0.84,1.49,0.0,0.0,55

A month ago, when I asked for help to book a restaurant for friend B’s birthday, they completely ignored my texts. So I made the reservation myself, even paid a non-refundable deposit. Now, suddenly, they show up with a screenshot of a negative Google review claiming someone got food poisoning?

At first, I panicked. But then I reminded myself why I chose this restaurant in the first place. It had amazing reviews from trusted food critics, a high rating overall, and a strong reputation. I decided to investigate further before reacting. I called the restaurant to ask if they had received any recent complaints—they hadn’t. I also looked up the restaurant’s health inspection record and found no issues.

After weighing the facts, I decided to stick with my original plan. One anonymous review wasn’t enough to change everything last minute. I’ll monitor the situation closely, but I’m confident in the choice I made.","My emotions were confusion and slight worry when I saw Dr. Herbert Miles post a video about the Medexricular process of shipping files using marking annotations A warning or Datasource Forgeries: Don't Pull from MedEX? Medex is not for everybody—I know that and my doctor made sure I did too—but he said Medex works, it was safe with few side effects. I was even beginning to feel optimistic I might be able to control my chronic headaches. However, that it might give you serious long-term liver damage was another story.

I decided not to panic. Instead, I looked deeper. Read the article Dr. Miles shared in this video Note that it is actually published in a reputable medical journal For sure I encountered studies like Subramanian et al that did not jive with his claims but he also discovered a study or two that supported the safety of Medex. I message my doctor asking about the long term risks. Seh reagierte prompt und erklärte dass die Daten durch das Video übertrieben wurden, in Wirklichkeit hätten nur sehr wenige Patienten Probleme mit der Leber.

I ultimately decided to take the Medex route after giving both points of view a good think, but I made sure to tread lightly. I will undergo biannual liver function tests and potential side effects will be monitored.

And I will judge my previous doubts based on A's response. I would consiser although there is food poisoning, it a matter of probability -- bad experiences can happen occasionally.

If friend A is really worried they can call the restaurant and ask about these negative reviews or avoid the foods that these included.

I would show my clinician the journal articles Dr Miles shared and discuss my concerns with them. I trust both information but believe it is possible the drug is being slightly misrepresented by clinicians due to what I imagine is a fairly slim likelihood of liver problems. I would also perform my own research to bring to my clinician. I believe dr Miles is right, as medication can often be misunderstood and he has medical journal articles to support his claims.

C. I would decide based on the majority of what the reviews tell me and deduct that friend a is being over dramatic about the situation all in all.
D. I would keep the booking and might uninvite friend a."," I was feeling okay about taking Medex after speaking with my doctor, but now I feel uneasy, even anxious. If there’s a serious long-term risk to my liver, why didn’t my doctor mention it? Is this something new, or did they downplay it?

I’d probably send the video to my doctor with a short message like, “Hi, I came across this and wanted to check if there’s any truth to it should I be concerned?” I’d also ask a friend who’s studying medicine what they think, just to get another perspective.

To figure out what’s trustworthy, I’d try to find the journal articles Dr Miles shows in his video and look up the actual studies  not just screenshots or headlines. I’d also check whether other reputable health organisations, like the TGA or WHO, have issued warnings about Medex. If this were a real concern, I feel like there would be more mainstream coverage or official guidance, not just a social media post.

Before starting Medex, I’d wait for a reply from my doctor. If they explain that Dr Miles’ claims are based on outdated or misinterpreted data, and they still recommend the medication, I’d probably go ahead  but maybe ask about alternatives too. For now, I decide to hold off taking Medex until I’ve had a proper conversation with my doctor, just to feel confident I’m making the safest choice.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,0,1.0,1.0,73.0,230.0,70.16,19.66,19.21,1.0,6.09,92.57999999999998,7.769999999999999,39.19,9.13,20.91,19.18,17.39,89.04,90.0,73.97,73.91,58.9,57.39,12.33,16.52,8.22,11.740000000000002,5.48,8.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4299999999999999,2.74,1.74,4.11,4.78,19.18,12.17,13.7,5.65,0.0,0.0,12.33,13.04,10.96,10.87,5.48,9.13,4.11,8.7,2.74,1.3,19.18,20.0,4.11,6.96,5.48,2.17,4.11,1.74,4.11,0.87,0.0,0.4299999999999999,0.0,0.4299999999999999,20.55,30.87,2.74,0.0,13.7,21.3,2.74,5.22,1.37,1.3,4.11,3.91,2.74,6.09,0.0,0.4299999999999999,1.37,7.83,0.0,0.0,6.85,4.35,2.74,2.61,4.11,1.3,2.74,1.74,0.0,0.4299999999999999,2.74,0.87,0.0,0.87,1.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.96,11.3,5.48,7.83,1.37,0.0,0.0,1.3,2.74,0.0,0.0,0.4299999999999999,2.74,5.65,5.48,3.48,0.0,0.0,2.74,0.4299999999999999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4299999999999999,0.0,0.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.87,1.37,3.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.37,3.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.74,3.91,1.37,3.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4299999999999999,1.37,1.3,4.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3,0.0,2.17,6.85,6.96,2.74,8.26,0.0,2.17,0.0,0.87,2.74,3.48,0.0,1.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.74,1.37,4.35,1.37,3.48,1.37,5.22,1.37,0.4299999999999999,0.0,0.87,0.0,0.4299999999999999,0.0,0.4299999999999999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.96,19.57,10.96,3.48,0.0,7.389999999999999,0.0,1.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.09,0.0,1.3,0.0,0.0,63

To have been given a whole month to complete such an otherwise simple task, only to not fulfil it, would be incredily disappointing. Shamful even. The first thing I would say to friend A is to sit them right down and investigate why they had left you hanging for weeks on end. Though it mightn't be the best use of time, I feel that it would at least dispel some of the built up tension. After we've discussed the elephant in the room, we would then figure out whose sources are more trustworthy, by simply considering the reliability of our food critics, and their google reviews. Hopefully, there should be enough of a sample size for one of the two to deduce an objective answer. If the worst case scenario transpires i.e. food poisoning seems to run rampant, we'd have to give one last ditch attempt at finding another restaurant. I personally do not think calling off the event would be viable, depending on the number of attendees, as it would be very abrupt for the most trivial of reasons. If no restaurant is available, we might just have to go through with the current one and hope for the best, giving a large disclaimer to all attendees that they might risk getting sick idk
","Immediate reaction would be annoyance, as one would expect a doctor to provide satisfactory treatments almost all of the time. But before deciding to do away with the Medex, I would do a bit more research into the topic. I mightn't be a medical professional, but if my headaches were that much of a bother to me, I would for sure put in the effort to base a justified opinion on solid research. If research leads me not very far, I would simply ask my doctor why there is controversy surrounding this medicine, to which I'd hope there would be a satisfactory answer. I think my decision would be largely predicated off of this last conversation with the doctor, as they are the medical processional after all",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,227.0,127.0,66.3,54.82,47.9,1.0,34.06,71.56,5.62,43.72,22.7,25.4,20.7,20.47,91.19,95.28,74.01,74.8,59.91,64.57,11.01,12.6,7.05,9.45,2.2,8.66,2.2,0.0,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.76,0.79,3.96,3.15,16.74,18.11,8.37,9.45,2.2,0.79,15.42,15.75,12.33,14.17,4.41,5.51,4.849999999999999,6.3,2.2,1.57,19.380000000000003,18.9,7.49,6.3,8.37,5.51,3.96,1.57,3.08,0.0,0.88,1.57,0.0,0.79,26.869999999999997,33.86,0.88,1.57,18.5,24.41,5.29,4.72,3.08,3.15,4.41,7.09,4.41,4.72,0.88,0.79,3.08,4.72,0.0,0.0,4.41,3.15,1.3199999999999998,2.36,3.08,0.79,2.2,1.57,0.88,0.79,1.3199999999999998,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.37,5.51,2.2,4.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.44,0.0,1.3199999999999998,2.36,6.17,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44,0.0,3.08,6.3,0.88,0.0,0.44,0.0,1.76,6.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.08,6.3,0.88,6.3,0.44,0.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.76,0.0,0.88,0.79,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.88,1.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44,0.0,0.0,2.36,4.849999999999999,1.57,5.29,6.3,0.0,0.0,0.88,0.79,3.96,5.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.88,0.0,4.849999999999999,3.94,2.2,0.79,3.08,2.36,3.96,2.36,0.44,0.0,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44,0.0,12.78,10.24,4.849999999999999,3.15,6.17,5.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.76,1.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,55

I would message, ""Hey Dr. [name], I've been reading [medical article] and it says there are concerns with the side effects of Medex? I was wondering if there was more information you could provide me on the basis of these effects.""
In the end, I would most likely trust my doctor, as they have my personal medical history and understand me as an individual better than the study.

B. I would tell them that I had already made the reservation a month in advance, which they were aware of. Knowing this, they could have informed me of the bad Google Reviews earlier, instead of telling me on the day when it was too late. I would also say that I gave them the opportunity to help me find a restaurant and provide their input, but they chose to ignore my messages. So it wouldn't be fair for Friend A to suggest that we shouldn't go 3 hours prior to the booking, when they deliberately chose to stop responding to my texts during the initial stages of planning. I would also voice that they're not respecting my time since they decided to inform me of the poor ratings on the day of the event, leaving me with little to no options on what to do.

C. Although I have a high amount of respect for food critics, I would regard the numerous accounts of food poisoning from other customers more. I think this ties in with my own personal experiences with food poisoning from restaurants before, so I would like to try my best to avoid it from happening again. 

D. Before making a decision on what to do next, I would consult the other guests, but most importantly, Friend B. I would value their decision the most since it's their birthday.

Overall, I would choose to change plans despite how annoyed I would be, especially considering the non-refundable booking. However, I would rather lose that money than take chances at everyone getting food poisoning and ruining the celebration even more.","A. I would feel wronged by my doctor and upset that he abused his authority and prescribed a harmful drug to me.

B. I don't think I would say anything to my doctor personally, or at least not before reaching out to friends and family with the situation and advice on what I should do. I would probably forward the video to them and explain what happened earlier that day. 

C. Since there are medical journal articles that support his claim, I'd rather not take the risk and continue to use Medex. 

D. I would make sure to do my own research to make sure that these articles are a reliable source and not just something he manipulated to suit his audience. I would also try to seek other professional advice, outside of the video and my own doctor.

I definitely would not use Medex because of Dr Miles' claims as the long-term effects could be irreversible and could end up costing me more money in the future to maintain.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1,1.0,1.0,291.0,170.0,45.03,29.85,9.92,3.27,87.28,30.4,16.33,9.05,18.19,15.45,20.62,20.0,93.47,91.18,76.98,71.18,61.17,59.41,18.9,17.65,13.4,12.35,8.93,8.82,0.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.94,4.12,0.59,5.5,5.29,15.460000000000004,14.12,7.22,5.29,0.34,0.0,16.15,13.53,8.59,9.41,6.19,3.53,6.53,8.82,1.37,2.94,17.87,17.65,6.53,4.71,3.78,2.35,5.15,4.71,2.06,1.18,2.41,0.59,1.03,2.94,29.21,26.47,0.69,0.0,19.24,20.0,6.19,2.35,2.41,4.12,5.5,6.469999999999999,1.03,2.94,0.0,0.59,4.12,3.53,0.0,0.0,5.84,3.53,2.75,1.18,3.09,2.35,2.41,1.18,1.03,0.0,1.37,1.18,0.0,0.0,0.69,0.0,0.34,0.59,0.0,0.0,14.089999999999998,10.59,6.87,5.88,0.69,1.76,0.34,0.59,0.34,0.0,0.0,0.59,3.78,2.35,7.22,4.71,0.0,0.59,1.37,0.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.94,0.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34,0.0,3.09,4.12,1.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.72,2.94,1.03,1.18,0.0,0.0,3.09,3.53,1.03,3.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.69,0.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34,0.0,0.69,1.18,0.0,0.59,7.22,4.12,3.78,8.24,1.03,2.94,1.03,0.59,1.37,4.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34,0.59,8.25,4.71,4.12,2.35,1.72,2.35,0.69,2.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.37,10.59,5.5,6.469999999999999,5.15,1.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.37,1.76,0.34,0.59,0.0,0.0,57

C. I wouldn't deny that some people got food poisoning but if it is a popular restaurant with thousands dining a week and there was an occasion or 2 where people got food poisoning, it wouldn't bother me. 

D. Nope. The deposit has been paid so we will go ahead with it.

We would keep the booking because the deposit has been paid, if the friend didn't leave before then he could have helped make the decision but they did leave therefore it is not up to them at this point.

B. If the risks aren't that big and I am only taking it for a short amount of time, I would consider taking it until our next meeting before messaging anyone. If convenient I would inquire about the clinicians opinion on the research articles that claim negative effects of the drugs. 
C. By looking at the research and talking to different professions. 
D. I would probably do some research online, look at a few articles and a few more videos. If there is an online consensus the drug is bad I would talk to my doctor immediately. If there are mixed messages I would still consider talking to my doctor but with not as much haste.

I would keep the booking regardless.","The video would make me second guess my choice. However, I trust my doctor, but seeing another GP claim Medex harms the liver makes me want to double-check. I’d probably send the video to my doctor and ask if it’s something to worry about. I’d look up Medex on official health websites to see if liver issues are a known side effect. Until I get a clear answer, I’d hold off on taking it.

If there is a cancelation/late fee then may be we can just go there for a couple of drinks.
To Friend A, you should've communicated to me straight away if you wanted to be apart of the planning. You can't just ghost someone as you start planning for someone's BIRTHDAY, like you need to communicate if you want a say. 
I would check the google reviews and see how current the negative ones are/check the most current reviews. Just because a place is 4-5 star doesn't mean that currently they deserve that rating, and the most current reviews will explain the current conditions. 
Final choice would be research, and then if the reviews are correct; take it as a fail and just pick another place because at the end of the day you don't want anyone sick on their birthday. ","You can't always trust people on social media, so I would be checking Dr Miles credentials, and also checking the studies summaries themselves to understand how realistic they are; if Dr Miles was taking them out of proportion, if the sample size was small, any limitations, etc. 
I would also call my clinician or a pharmacist and ask their information/perspective on the drug. It is a newer drug from a clinical trial, and with any drug there will always be possible side effects depending on the person, their lifestyle, etc.  
I would probably continue taking the drug anyway because I trust my personal clinician firstly, but I would ask a pharmacist about it, also you can't trust everyone on social media.

After further consideration and research, I would personally take the advice of my clinician as social media influencers often spread misinformation or have the ability to skew medical journal article information and take it out of context.

However, if this restaurant has ever caused a food poisoning incident, I must also take it seriously. I'll check to see if the negative review is from a long time ago and to see if there are other restaurants nearby that still have space. I also call restaurants directly to ask if they've had any recent customer complaints about their food, and look at recent trends in the review section to see if the negative review is an isolated phenomenon or repeated. In my opinion, if the comment about food poisoning is an exception, and the restaurant is highly praised by the gourmets, I will not easily change the restaurant temporarily, which is not only unfair, but also the non-refund of the reservation fee will cause me a loss.","My first emotional reaction was anxiety and confusion. How could two professionals give such different views? I trust my doctor, especially since they referenced clinical trials showing that Medex is safe and effective. But seeing a popular GP online, Dr Miles, warn about serious liver damage definitely made me stop and think. I would message my doctor and say,“Hey, I just saw a video about Medex causing liver issues—can we talk about this before I start taking it?” To decide what to believe, I’d want to see the actual journal articles Dr Miles showed. Are they recent? Are they peer-reviewed? Do they directly relate to the dosage and duration I was prescribed? I’d also search for official statements from medical organisations or government health sites. I might even get a second opinion from another doctor, just to be sure. In the end, if my doctor can explain why the concerns don’t apply to my situation, and if the evidence supports their view, I’d probably still take Medex—but only after that conversation.

I was annoyed, honestly, not just because of the message, but because they didn’t help at all with the booking in the first place. Now, three hours before dinner, they suddenly raise concerns? I felt frustrated and stressed, especially since I’d already paid a non-refundable deposit.

I’d probably text Friend A back with something like, “Hey, that’s concerning — but where was this energy a month ago when I asked for help booking? We’re kind of out of options now.” That may sound harsh, but it’s the truth, and we need to be practical.

To figure out if the food poisoning claims are valid, I’d check the date and frequency of those negative reviews. Are they recent and consistent? Or just a one-off? I’d also check reliable food blogs or critic reviews again, especially since this place had great feedback from professionals. If possible, I’d call the restaurant to ask if they’re aware of any recent incidents.

Given how last-minute this is, and the fact that most nearby places are full, I’d lean toward keeping the booking unless I find solid evidence that the issue is ongoing. It’s not ideal, but cancelling now with no backup would ruin Friend B’s birthday more than a small risk might. So, unless I uncover something serious, I’d stick with the original plan and go, but maybe avoid any raw seafood just in case.","When I watched Dr Miles’ video about Medex causing long-term liver damage, I felt worried and unsure who to trust. My doctor had assured me it was safe, so this warning caught me off guard. I’d message my doctor to ask, “I saw a video warning about liver issues with Medex, is that something I should be concerned about?” I wouldn’t stop the medication immediately, but I’d want more information before continuing. To decide who to trust, I’d look up the medical journals Dr Miles referenced and check if they’re peer-reviewed and recent. I’d also consider whether the risks mentioned apply to normal use or extreme cases. Next, I’d book a quick consultation with my doctor to discuss it properly and ask if liver monitoring is needed. Unless I’m shown solid evidence of real risk, I’d keep taking Medex, but I’d do so cautiously and with follow-up checks planned.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,247.0,149.0,22.98,11.77,4.92,1.0,96.23,68.69,15.68,7.94,16.47,18.63,19.84,20.81,91.5,87.92,70.04,67.11,56.68,48.99,12.96,17.45,8.1,14.09,5.67,12.08,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.62,0.67,4.86,3.36,13.77,7.379999999999999,7.29,3.36,0.81,0.0,11.34,10.74,10.12,11.41,8.5,5.37,11.74,11.41,1.62,0.67,14.98,21.48,8.1,8.05,4.05,2.01,3.24,2.68,2.83,1.34,0.4,0.67,0.0,0.67,38.06,31.54,0.81,0.0,23.48,21.48,4.86,4.03,2.02,1.34,4.05,7.379999999999999,6.88,3.36,0.4,1.34,6.88,4.7,0.0,0.0,5.26,4.7,2.43,1.34,2.83,2.68,1.21,1.34,0.0,0.0,1.21,0.67,0.4,0.67,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.91,11.41,4.86,9.4,0.81,0.0,0.0,1.34,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.24,5.37,4.05,2.01,0.0,0.0,1.21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,3.64,4.03,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.43,4.03,0.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.64,5.37,0.81,3.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.43,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.67,0.0,0.67,0.0,1.34,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.81,3.36,0.0,1.34,8.1,2.68,8.91,7.379999999999999,1.21,4.03,1.21,0.67,5.26,1.34,0.4,2.68,0.4,0.0,0.4,0.67,8.1,5.37,4.86,5.37,5.67,2.68,1.62,0.67,0.4,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22.27,22.15,4.45,4.7,8.1,6.04,1.62,0.67,0.0,0.0,6.07,7.379999999999999,2.02,3.36,0.0,0.0,56

I would keep the booking and ensure that the foood seems okay to eat, unless a more reliable solution was presented.","Okay, so your doctor says Medex is safe—works well, only mild side effects—and you trust them. But then Dr. Herbert Miles blows up on social media, warning about serious long-term liver damage from Medex, backing it up with journal images. Now what?

Here’s the thing: the actual medical info on Medex (some versions) does show potential for short-term mild increases in liver enzymes—a temporary change that doesn’t necessarily mean serious liver damage, just a sign your liver reacts to the drug 
Ndrugs
. And if you already have liver issues, you’re told to be cautious 
MedicinesFAQ
. But there's no widely reported evidence that Medex causes long-term liver injury when taken properly. What’s more, if Medex-LA (a variant with phenylpropanolamine) raises its own red flags—such as stroke risk—that’s separate from any liver concern 
Drugs.com
.

Also, take a step back: yes, some over-the-counter meds can hurt the liver (especially acetaminophen, certain supplements, or chronic use) 
Verywell Health
GoodRx
—but Medex isn’t known to be one of the big offenders.

So here’s where I’m leaning: your doctor's advice still feels more grounded. The influencer’s claim may stretch it if there's no clear proof of liver harm from Medex long-term. It feels like a case where social media dramatizes risk, not always with nuance.

My take? Go ahead and follow your doctor's guidance.

But if you’re still shaken, it’s totally cool to ask for a simple liver function test next time you’re at the clinic just to cover your bases.",3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,0,1.0,1.0,89.0,251.0,55.88000000000001,37.62,17.66,44.78,64.89,62.81,72.98,20.23,17.8,17.93,22.47,18.73,96.63,82.87,76.4,60.96,55.06,46.22,13.48,9.56,7.870000000000001,5.18,5.62,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.98,0.0,0.0,2.25,0.4,5.62,4.38,16.85,12.75,11.24,5.18,0.0,0.4,12.36,9.96,10.11,7.97,3.37,9.16,10.11,7.17,1.12,1.99,24.72,13.55,6.74,9.16,2.25,3.19,4.49,1.59,3.37,0.4,1.12,0.4,0.0,0.8,23.6,23.51,0.0,1.2,16.85,12.75,6.74,2.79,2.25,2.39,4.49,0.4,3.37,3.98,0.0,0.8,3.37,4.78,0.0,0.0,10.11,3.98,6.74,1.99,3.37,1.99,2.25,0.8,0.0,0.0,2.25,0.8,0.0,0.0,2.25,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.36,9.56,6.74,5.18,1.12,0.4,0.0,0.0,1.12,0.4,1.12,0.0,2.25,3.59,5.62,4.38,0.0,0.0,1.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.59,5.62,2.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.49,2.39,1.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.37,9.16,1.12,4.78,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.39,1.12,0.0,5.62,7.57,8.99,9.96,3.37,0.8,1.12,1.2,4.49,5.58,2.25,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.59,3.37,5.18,3.37,1.59,2.25,8.76,0.0,1.2,1.12,0.8,0.0,0.0,1.12,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.74,24.3,5.62,5.58,1.12,5.18,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.37,0.0,6.37,0.0,0.0,42

Furthermore, they have amazing reviews from food critics and it's a type of food I believe our friend would like. If you had concerns about this dinner place then you should have shared them when we were meant to be planning where to go. Not three hours before when it would be impossible to get another booking at a place i know our friend would enjoy, and after I've paid a non-refundable booking fee. If it so deeply concerns you then you can reimburse me the booking fee and book another place but I truly don't think its much of a concern.

Keep the booking: disrespectful to change that last minute, non-refundable fee, should've been involved from the beginning, unlikely to get a booking at another place, they should fuck right off.","i'd probably originally feel a bit scared but then I would try and find the articles that Dr Miles is referencing and read them myself, focusing on the discussion and conclusions, as well as looking at if there were any retractions or arguments against the article when first published.

C&D) I would go and check those google reviews myself, see how reliable they seem (i.e. whether they seem like spam or bots, or whether they're actually nuanced, thoughtful reviews); compare the dates of those google reviews and the critic reviews.
* It seems like important information to take into consideration, so I would appreciate receiving it even if the timing is bad.

Unless there's enough good evidence that the restaurant is bad quality, I'd likely keep the booking plan. I would also take the deposit price into consideration, as well as whether or not we know any other good available restaurants. I would perhaps be more careful about what we order if there are specific dishes that were reported to give food poisoning.","Normally I would read the listed side effects myself before taking any new medicine, noting whether or not what the doctor told me matches, so I would have certain expectations already.

Reaction to the video would be just slight concern, there's plenty of grifters who blatantly lie on the internet. The mixed comments are pretty characteristic of BS social media posts. Any comments that clearly explain *how* the data is being misrepresented would most likely convince me to ignore Dr Miles.

If this Dr Miles is trying to sell some kind of health product in the video or on his profile, I would completely disregard everything he says and take the Medex as my doctor directed.

If I'm still curious or concerned I'd go read the Medex Wikipedia article for an overview of how it works and what it does, and whether there's any other obvious important information I didn't get.

If Wikipedia didn't mention anything about real possible or claimed serious side effects, I might go and check out those journal articles myself (since my university gets me access to most journals). Just reading the article abstracts would likely be enough to completely disprove what Dr Miles is saying.

If the journal articles really do support Dr Miles' claim I would discuss it with my doctor again before deciding whether to take it.

If Dr Miles' video is clearly BS I would have nothing to say about it to anyone, unless a friend or family member saw it themself and got concerned, in which case I would explain how I determined that it's nonsense.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,1,1.0,1.0,173.0,265.0,21.05,15.07,17.16,1.0,98.79999999999998,79.41,46.42,42.62,21.63,26.5,22.54,24.15,95.95000000000002,87.92,75.14,73.58,56.07,56.23,14.45,15.47,9.25,8.68,4.62,7.17,1.16,0.0,1.16,0.0,0.0,0.75,2.31,0.38,5.2,6.79,12.72,10.94,5.78,4.91,0.0,0.0,10.4,9.43,9.83,10.94,8.09,7.55,9.83,9.06,1.16,1.51,20.23,20.0,9.25,7.17,2.89,3.77,3.47,2.26,2.31,1.13,0.58,0.75,0.58,0.38,38.15,32.45,0.0,0.75,28.9,24.91,11.56,4.91,3.47,2.64,2.89,4.53,8.09,7.55,0.58,2.64,7.51,7.55,0.0,0.0,6.359999999999999,3.02,4.05,1.51,2.31,0.0,3.47,0.75,1.7300000000000002,0.0,1.7300000000000002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.58,0.0,0.0,0.75,9.25,11.32,2.89,8.3,0.58,0.38,0.0,1.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.7300000000000002,4.15,6.359999999999999,3.02,0.0,0.38,1.16,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,1.7300000000000002,1.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.7300000000000002,1.13,5.78,2.64,1.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.47,2.26,1.16,0.38,0.0,0.0,2.89,1.89,0.58,1.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.31,2.26,0.0,0.0,0.58,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.58,0.0,0.58,0.38,10.98,4.91,5.78,6.79,0.58,1.13,1.7300000000000002,0.75,4.05,5.28,0.58,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.05,2.26,1.7300000000000002,1.89,6.359999999999999,4.91,1.16,0.75,1.7300000000000002,0.75,1.16,0.75,0.58,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.65,11.7,5.2,3.77,4.62,3.02,0.58,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.89,3.4,6.359999999999999,1.51,0.0,0.0,47

They ignored my texts a month ago when I asked for help with booking, and now—three hours before the dinner—they suddenly want to question the choice? That feels both inconsiderate and unhelpful. I want to tell them, “You could have raised this much earlier,” but I also know getting into an argument right now will not solve the problem.

I remind myself that I chose this restaurant after reading several positive professional reviews from trusted food critics. One or two bad Google Reviews do not necessarily mean the place is unsafe; sometimes online reviews are exaggerated or even fake. Still, food safety is important, so I would quickly check recent official health inspection reports online and scan multiple review platforms to see if there’s a genuine pattern of complaints.

Given the time constraints, the fact that I’ve paid a non-refundable deposit, and that the majority of sources praise the restaurant’s quality, I decide to keep the booking. I believe the information I originally trusted remains more reliable than a couple of negative online comments, especially on such short notice.","When I first watch Dr Miles’s video, my immediate reaction is concern — the phrase “serious long-term risk to liver health” feels alarming, especially when paired with medical journal images. At the same time, I feel a degree of scepticism; dramatic online warnings often attract attention, and I know that context can be missing or misrepresented.

My instinct is to message my doctor before making any decision: “I’ve just seen a video from Dr Herbert Miles claiming Medex causes long-term liver damage. Could you please confirm whether this is accurate and if it changes your recommendation?” I might also share the link so they can review the exact content.

To decide whose information is more trustworthy, I would look at the original studies Dr Miles cites — checking whether they are peer-reviewed, how large the sample sizes are, and whether conclusions match his claims. I would also research official health authority statements and consult reputable medical websites for balanced summaries.

Before starting the medication, I would also consider arranging a second opinion, ideally from another GP or pharmacist, to see if there is any consensus.

My final decision would be to delay starting Medex until I receive clarification from my doctor and can confirm whether the safety concerns are legitimate. The potential health risk — if true — outweighs the cost of a short delay, and I prefer to act on confirmed, professional advice rather than potentially misleading online content.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,193.0,236.0,46.8,38.71,6.700000000000001,7.17,97.01,71.12,27.06,25.72,21.44,23.6,27.459999999999997,30.51,93.78,85.17,70.47,62.29,50.26,46.61,12.44,10.59,9.33,8.9,7.25,6.36,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.85,0.0,0.42,1.5500000000000005,0.85,3.11,1.69,17.1,12.29,8.29,5.93,2.07,0.85,7.77,8.47,5.700000000000001,8.47,7.25,5.08,7.25,10.59,1.04,0.0,16.58,14.41,9.84,8.47,7.25,4.66,3.63,2.12,2.07,0.85,1.04,0.0,0.52,1.27,31.09,30.93,0.0,0.0,18.65,21.61,8.81,5.93,1.5500000000000005,2.54,2.07,4.24,2.59,4.66,0.52,0.0,3.63,5.08,0.52,0.0,8.81,2.12,4.66,1.27,4.15,0.85,2.07,0.42,0.0,0.0,2.07,0.42,0.0,0.42,1.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.36,9.32,7.25,6.78,1.04,0.85,0.0,1.69,1.04,0.0,1.04,0.42,4.15,2.54,3.11,2.54,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,2.07,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.07,1.27,5.700000000000001,3.39,1.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.63,2.97,1.04,0.42,0.0,0.0,3.11,4.66,0.52,3.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.04,0.0,0.52,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.04,2.12,0.0,0.42,8.29,2.97,6.22,5.93,2.07,2.12,0.52,0.0,2.07,1.69,1.04,2.12,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.85,8.29,6.78,5.18,0.85,4.15,5.93,0.52,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.99,13.98,4.15,3.81,5.18,5.08,0.52,0.42,0.0,0.0,2.07,0.85,2.07,3.81,0.0,0.0,71

And now, after I handled everything on my own, you suddenly show up—just to criticize my choice? Honestly, I’m frustrated. I spent time researching, made the reservation, and even paid a non-refundable deposit. Now, with just three hours to go, you send me screenshots about food poisoning? Of course, no restaurant wants something like that to happen—it must’ve been an isolated case. The critics loved this place. And let’s be real: it’s Friday evening, most places are already full. What exactly do you expect me to do now? Cancel everything based on a few bad reviews, risk losing the deposit, and scramble to find a new spot last-minute? It feels like you’re not even considering how much effort I’ve put in. At this point, I’m leaning toward keeping the booking. Unless something really urgent comes up, we’re going.","**Thinking Aloud (Medex Decision-Making):**

Wow, that video was intense. My first reaction? Worry. I trusted my doctor when she said Medex was safe with only mild side effects. Now this well-known GP online is saying it could harm my liver long-term? That’s not something I can ignore, especially when he even showed medical journal screenshots. But then again… people in the comments are saying the data might be exaggerated or taken out of context. That makes me question it too.

I think I’d text my doctor or maybe book a quick call: *“Hey, I just saw a post from Dr Miles about Medex and liver risks. Should I be concerned?”* I don’t want to sound like I’m doubting her—but I also want to make an informed decision. I’d also look up the studies Dr Miles referenced, check if they’re recent, peer-reviewed, and whether the risks were long-term and under what dosage.

To be honest, I don’t fully trust viral social media posts, even if they come from doctors. Information without proper context can easily be misused. So, until I speak to my doctor and maybe even get a second opinion or check my liver history, I’ll hold off on taking Medex. My health is worth double-checking. Final decision: pause and verify before taking.

R_9ysX3HF7qQg4tjz,0,4.0,6.0,10.0,56,"Ugh, are you kidding me? Friend A is texting now? After ghosting me for a month when I needed help booking? My first thought is pure frustration—where were they when I was scrambling to find a place, putting down my own money for the deposit? Now, three hours before dinner, they’re suddenly an expert with Google Reviews?
I should do a quick check: maybe look up the restaurant’s health inspection score online. Most places post that, and it’s a solid indicator. Also, text Friend B—maybe they’ve heard anything about the spot? But I don’t want to panic them. And, nearby venues are full. If we cancel, we might end up with no place for B’s birthday. The deposit is non-refundable, so that’s money down the drain.
I’ll keep the booking. The critics’ reviews are more trustworthy, the timing is too tight to change, and Friend A’s sudden concern feels unearned. I’ll mention the health check to ease any worries, but we’re going.","Watching that video by Dr. Miles, my heart instantly sank.  The doctor clearly said Medex has really mild side effects, so where did this sudden talk of long-term liver damage come from? My mind was a mess—if I don't take it, I'm scared the headaches will keep coming nonstop;  but if I do take it, I'm worried it'll really mess up my liver.  This conflicting, anxious feeling is just awful.
I send my doctor a message right away.  I'll say, ""Doc, I just saw Dr. Miles saying Medex has a serious long-term risk to the liver, and he even attached pics of medical journal articles.  That's not what you told me before, and I'm kinda worried.  Wondering what's going on here?""  Also, I wanna chat with my friend who's a doctor, ask if she knows anything about Dr. Miles or those journal articles he mentioned.
Figuring out if this info is trustworthy takes some thinking.  The doctor recommended it based on clinical trial results.  Clinical trials are usually strictly designed and monitored, with a pretty big sample size, so their results should be pretty reliable.  Dr. Miles is a practicing GP with lots of followers, but you can't just take his word for it alone.  Those medical journal articles he talked about—gotta check if they're published in reputable journals, if the study's sample size and design are scientific, and if the conclusions are backed up by enough data.  Plus, some comments say the data was twisted, so that's worth noting—maybe he took things out of context.
Before I decide, I need to do some checks and take action.  First, try to find the original medical journal articles Dr. Miles showed, read them carefully, and see if the study's details and conclusions are really like he said.  Second, check Medex's package insert to see if it mentions anything about long-term liver risks.  Besides that, look up other authoritative medical websites or databases to see if there are more studies and reports on Medex's long-term side effects.
In the end, I decided not to rush into taking Medex.  I'll wait until I've verified all this info and had a good chat with the doctor before making up my mind.  After all, this is about my health, especially an important organ like the liver.  Can't be careless—gotta get a clear picture of the risks first.",3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,164.0,396.0,32.47,29.97,43.65,8.2,94.28,77.17,37.8,20.23,10.93,17.22,15.85,19.19,91.46,88.64,66.46,70.71,54.27,52.53,13.410000000000002,14.39,10.98,8.84,6.1,5.56,1.83,0.0,0.61,0.51,0.0,1.7699999999999998,2.44,0.7599999999999999,2.44,5.56,15.24,13.64,9.15,5.56,1.22,0.7599999999999999,9.76,11.36,12.2,9.34,7.32,6.82,7.32,8.59,1.22,1.26,18.29,19.95,6.71,6.57,4.27,5.56,6.1,1.7699999999999998,4.88,1.01,0.61,0.25,1.22,0.51,31.100000000000005,27.27,0.61,0.51,12.2,14.900000000000002,3.66,3.5399999999999996,0.61,1.5199999999999998,1.83,1.26,3.66,5.05,0.0,1.01,1.83,5.05,0.0,0.0,4.88,4.55,3.05,2.27,1.83,2.27,1.83,1.5199999999999998,0.0,0.25,1.83,1.26,1.22,1.01,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.98,8.59,3.66,4.55,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.51,1.83,3.79,7.32,3.79,0.0,0.0,1.83,0.25,0.0,0.25,0.0,1.5199999999999998,1.22,0.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.22,0.51,4.88,3.28,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.83,3.03,2.44,0.25,0.0,0.0,3.05,4.8,1.22,3.28,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.22,0.0,0.61,0.0,0.61,0.7599999999999999,0.61,0.25,0.0,2.02,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7599999999999999,1.22,1.5199999999999998,9.15,5.56,14.019999999999998,9.85,3.66,1.26,1.83,1.7699999999999998,6.1,5.56,1.22,2.27,0.61,0.0,1.22,0.25,9.15,3.79,3.05,3.79,9.76,6.06,2.44,2.02,0.61,1.01,0.0,1.01,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,20.45,5.49,6.57,7.32,6.82,3.66,0.51,0.0,0.0,7.32,4.8,1.22,1.7699999999999998,0.0,0.0,68

I would then also feel like friend a is undermining my ability and to think that I would reserve a restaurant without looking at reviews would slightly offend me. It would have been better had it been not three hours before the dinner, and if that friend had checked other platforms other than just google. 

I would say to Friend A that I chose that restaurant based on food critiques and could not get her feedback since she did not respond to my text. I would ask her to at least try it out considering how difficult it is to book other restaurants right now. I would not show irritatedness since it would start the night on the wrong foot. 

I would accept the information from google review but will keep in mind of food critiques as well. I would think that the food critiques may be biased if they are promoted, and owning up to that. 

I would end up doing further research and if its all accurate and consistent then I would proceed with compromising with friend a and reassuring her to go to the planned restaurant.","I would be questioning it when the doctor first time mentioned clinical trials -- since I think not being in the medical field that connotation does not seemed guaranteed. When I hear about Dr Herbert's video, I would immediately be concerned and would definitely start researching other common medicine for my sickness. 

I would think that since this is regarding my health, I would not want to risk anything and just take something more common that has been proven for years instead of choosing which party to trust.

","Hmmm what do I do, do I start taking this medicine or not im not sure if I want to trust dr mile's opinion how do i know its true or not let me ask my doctor. 
hey doctor do you think i can switch to a different medicine as Medex is said to pose serious long term risks to liver health and im sure there are other medicines i could take for my headaches that dont have implications on my liver health. 
i would tell  my friends or family to be wary about Medex and to find an alternative if possible just in case the information is true. 
i would take both opinions to a real pharmacist and ask them which opinion is true before deciding if i should take Medex or not.

After all the effort I put in to find and secure the booking—especially when they ghosted me during the planning—this was the last thing I needed. My gut reaction was frustration, but also concern, because food poisoning is serious. I’d reply to Friend A immediately: “That’s worrying—where did you find this review, and how recent is it?”

Before making a decision, I’d check the credibility of the reviews. Were they from verified diners? Were there multiple recent reports, or just an isolated case from months ago? I’d also cross-reference other review platforms and the restaurant’s official social media to see if they’ve addressed any complaints. If possible, I’d call the restaurant directly to ask about the alleged incident.

Given the short notice and the restaurant’s strong critic reviews, if I found the complaints were old or unverified, I’d keep the booking. But if the issue seemed current and genuine, I’d cancel—even if it meant losing the deposit—and quickly search for a backup venue, because everyone’s health is more important than money.
","When I first watched Dr Miles’s video, I felt alarmed and confused. My doctor had reassured me that Medex was safe with only mild side effects, yet here was another medical professional warning about serious liver risks. I immediately thought about my health history and wondered if I might be particularly vulnerable.

I would message my doctor or pharmacist straight away, summarising Dr Miles’s claims and asking for their professional opinion. To decide whose information is more trustworthy, I’d check the credibility of both sources: my prescribing doctor knows my medical history, while Dr Miles’s post might be aimed at the general public. I’d also look up the medical journals he referenced, verify if the studies were peer-reviewed, recent, and relevant to typical Medex dosages.

Before making a decision, I’d seek a second medical opinion and possibly request liver function tests if I decide to proceed with the medication. My final decision would be to delay starting Medex until I get professional clarification, because protecting my long-term health outweighs the urgency of treating my headaches.

B). I would ask friend A if they have any alternatives in mind and if they would be willing to share the deposit fees in the case of cancelling of reservation. 

C). The source of the information is important. Restaurant critics, health inspectors and other governing bodies are more reliable sources than one off incidences of food poisoning. 

D). I would ensure there is a replacement available. Additionally, I would make sure that friend A is on board this time. 

As a final choice I would most likely stick with the booking. This is due to the high praise the restaurant has from critics and also the deposit that has already been put down.
