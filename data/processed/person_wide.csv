If there were many other similar reviews, I'd probably start looking for an alternative. If there were many reviews, but most were positive and there were very few other similar negative reviews, I would want to still go to the restaurant I picked. I would probably rely on the volume of reviews more than the source, but if there were not many reviews overall, I would weight the food critics reviews as more trustworthy than some random google reviewers.

In that message I would also tell them that I was feeling frustrated that they didn't help me find a restaurant in the first place, and I was upset that they assumed I would take on the mental load of organising the dinner for our shared friend.
My choice to keep the booking or change restaurant would be based on the other reviews on google etc that I had read today.

Once I read through the articles he quoted, if I felt the journal was clearly aligned with Dr Miles' interpretation, I would book another appointment with my doctor to discuss. However, it would depend on the Dr that originally prescribed me the drug.

I remember this restaurant being recommended by several food blogs and review platforms, and many people praised the service and food quality.

It’s too close to dinner time, and most nearby restaurants are fully booked.

This is Friend B’s birthday, and I don’t want to ruin it with last-minute changes.

It felt like a contradiction, and I didn’t know who to believe at first.

Is it true what he says about liver damage?” I also thought about sending the video to a couple of friends or family members to hear their opinions.

Before making any decision, I would do a few things:

1. Look up the journal articles Dr. Miles showed in his video and see if his interpretation matches the actual research.
2. Check whether those studies were recent, peer-reviewed, and supported by other research.
3. Look for other expert opinions from reliable medical websites or healthcare professionals—not just social media.

After reviewing everything, if there’s no strong scientific evidence to support his claims, and if my own doctor assures me again that Medex is safe for my condition, I would decide to **go ahead and take Medex**. I trust the medical advice from a trained professional who knows my health history more than a social media post, even if it’s from a licensed doctor.

I've done some research and the place I found has reviews from food critics which say the restaurant is fine. Furthermore, the information that says we could get food poisoning could have really been useful before I paid the deposit for the dinner. We are are keeping the booking.","Hmmmmmm... On one side my doctor has said that Medex it a safe drug which works well to combat recurring headaches. On the other hand, Dr Miles has provided clear evidence of serious risk to my liver health. I really should give those medical articles a read right away. I should ask my parents what they think about the whole situation and ask for their input.

The idea that Medex, which I’ve just been prescribed for headaches, could harm my liver is alarming, especially since the doctor mentioned minimal side effects. The images of medical journals he shows look convincing, but I don’t know if the data is being presented in the right context. My gut reaction is to feel a bit scared, but also skeptical because it feels like a lot of health claims on social media are often exaggerated or misleading.

I’d message my doctor right away to ask if they’re aware of any potential liver risks with Medex. I’d also talk to friends or family who are more knowledgeable about medications to get their perspective. I’d want to make sure the information I’m getting is well-rounded, so I’d also do some research myself, looking at reputable medical sources and possibly asking for a second opinion from another healthcare professional.

To decide which information is trustworthy, I’d prioritise sources like peer-reviewed journal articles, government health websites, and medical professionals over social media posts. I’d also cross-check Dr. Miles' claims with the package insert or official details on the medication.

In the end, my final decision would depend on the answers I get from my doctor and my own research. If the liver risk claims are confirmed, I might reconsider taking Medex or explore alternative treatments. However, if my doctor reassures me with scientific evidence, I’d likely proceed with the medication.",5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1

I’m a bit annoyed because they didn’t help at all with the booking and now they’re suddenly concerned. My gut reaction is that this feels like overreacting — the restaurant has good reviews from professional food critics, which I trust more than a few random Google Reviews. People complain online for all sorts of reasons, and sometimes those reviews aren’t even reliable.

I’d probably reply to Friend A with something like, “I get your concern, but it’s really last minute, and this place has been highly rated by critics. Are you sure those reviews aren’t just isolated incidents?”

To be sure, I’d quickly double-check the restaurant’s latest reviews, maybe scan their social media or any recent news about food safety. If there’s no widespread report of food poisoning, I’ll keep the booking.

Final choice: I’ll keep the booking because the critic reviews and lack of recent serious complaints seem more trustworthy, and changing plans now would be stressful and possibly ruin Friend B’s birthday.","My first reaction is worry — liver damage sounds serious, and I feel uneasy about taking Medex now. But at the same time, I remind myself that my doctor, who knows my medical history, recommended it and said the side effects are mild. Social media posts can be sensationalised to get attention, even if they show “evidence.”
I’d probably message my doctor or call the clinic tomorrow, saying something like, “I saw a video by Dr Herbert Miles warning about liver damage from Medex — is this a real concern?” I might also ask friends or family if they’ve heard anything similar, just to see if this is widely discussed.
To judge the trustworthiness, I’d look at whether Dr Miles cited recent peer-reviewed research or if the articles are old or taken out of context. I’d also check reputable health websites or government advisories.
Final decision: I’ll start Medex as prescribed for now because my headaches are recurring and my doctor assessed it as safe for me. But I’ll follow up with my doctor soon to clarify the liver risk and possibly explore alternatives if there’s solid evidence.

In addition, after booking the restaurant, friend A did not immediately communicate about the situation of their own restaurant. They only expressed their opinions now, which may not be because they have any objections to the restaurant itself, but only because they have their own ideas for this birthday party.

Secondly, I would like to communicate with clinical doctors that when prescribing over-the-counter drugs, detailed descriptions of the drug's effects and side effects should be provided, along with professional medical advice for patients to refer to, rather than simply stating mild side effects. Furthermore, regarding Dr. Miles' warning, a detailed understanding should be conducted on whether the long-term risk of this drug to the liver is within a controllable range. I will ultimately choose to continue taking this medication because Dr. Myers only introduced the side effects of this medication, but he did not provide a targeted medical assessment for my recurrent headache symptoms. Therefore, I chose to consult with my doctor for more information.",1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1
R_9dEoPRV5JbfOXpD,1,3.0,1.0,4.0,50,"When Friend A suddenly messaged about food poisoning claims at the restaurant, I felt a surge of frustration and suspicion. After being unresponsive for weeks, why raise concerns just three hours before dinner? The timing seemed calculated to create panic rather than solve problems.  

My immediate reply would be: *""Is this a recent review? The restaurant has excellent critic ratings, and we stand to lose our deposit. Honestly, why wait until the last possible moment to mention this?""*  

To properly assess the situation, I'd:  
1. Thoroughly examine the Google review - checking dates, credibility of the reviewer, and whether others reported similar issues  
2. Cross-reference with other review platforms and food blogs  
3. Call the restaurant directly to ask about recent health inspections  
4. Quickly research backup options, though chances of finding something good last-minute would be slim  

**Final Decision:**  
If the negative review appears to be an isolated incident amid overwhelmingly positive feedback, I'd keep the reservation - trusting professional critics' opinions over one questionable online review. The lost deposit would also factor into this decision. However, if I found multiple credible reports of recent health issues, I'd immediately contact Friend B to discuss alternatives, even if it meant paying another deposit elsewhere.  

Ultimately, I wouldn't let Friend A's eleventh-hour intervention derail plans without concrete evidence, but would prioritize everyone's safety if legitimate concerns emerged.  ","A. Immediate Emotional Reaction**  
My first reaction is a mix of confusion and anxiety. The doctor who prescribed Medex presented it as safe and effective, but now a seemingly credible source—Dr. Miles—is warning about serious liver risks. The conflicting information makes me uneasy, especially since headaches already impact my quality of life. I question why my doctor didn’t mention these risks and whether I’m missing critical information.  

**B. Communication with Others**  
I’d message my prescribing doctor: *""I saw Dr. Miles’ warning about Medex’s potential liver risks. Could you clarify if this applies to my case or if there are safer alternatives?""* To friends/family, I might ask: *""Have you heard about Medex’s side effects? A viral video is claiming it’s riskier than advertised.""* Their experiences could provide perspective.  

**C. Assessing Information Credibility**  
To evaluate the claims:  
1. **Verify Dr. Miles’ credentials**: Is he a reputable specialist, or does he have a history of controversy?  
2. **Examine the journal articles he cited**: Are they from peer-reviewed sources? Do the studies involve long-term human trials?  
3. **Check official health advisories**: Do FDA or other medical bodies mention these risks?  
4. **Review Medex’s official leaflet**: Does it disclose liver-related warnings?  

**D. Additional Actions**  
- Schedule a follow-up with my doctor to discuss concerns.  
- Research patient forums for firsthand experiences with Medex.  
- Consider starting with a half-dose while monitoring for side effects, if I proceed.  

**Final Decision**  
Unless Dr. Miles’ claims are backed by robust evidence, I’d likely take Medex as prescribed—but only after my doctor addresses the concerns. The clinical trial data and my doctor’s expertise outweigh a single viral video, but I’d stay alert for symptoms like fatigue or jaundice. If alternatives exist with similar efficacy but fewer risks, I’d request a switch.  

**Reasoning**: Medical decisions should prioritize trusted, verified sources over sensationalized claims, but patient advocacy matters too. I’d balance both by seeking clarification while proceeding cautiously.

My first gut reaction is fustration- I asked  Friend A to help plan this weeks ago, and now they suddenly come up with this warning at the last minute. I'm also worried about the risk: food poisoning is serious, but I also remember this restaurant has excellent reviews from professional food critics.
I would probably reply to Friend A riight away:""Thanks for flagging this- let me check quickyly, we can't afford to cancel for no reason.""
Then I would try to figure out whether these Google reviews are trustworthy. Are they recent? Do they look genuine or exaggerated? I might also check other review sites like Yelp or TripAdvisor for consistency.
Given that we’re so close to the dinner time, I’d probably also call the restaurant directly to ask if they’ve had any health inspection issues recently.
After weighing everything, unless there are many recent complaints, I’d keep the booking. The deposit is non-refundable, most restaurants nearby are likely fully booked, and the food critics’ reviews give me confidence.

To decide if it’s true, I would look at the date of the bad reviews. If they are old, maybe the problem is fixed now. I would also check if many people said the same thing, or just one or two.

Before I take the medicine, I would look up the studies myself and check if real health websites like the government or Mayo Clinic say anything about liver problems.

My first reaction is a mix of anxiety and confusion. The doctor prescribed Medex with confidence, but Dr. Miles’ warning about liver risks feels alarming, especially with the images of medical journals. I feel torn—should I trust my doctor or this online GP with a large following? The popularity of the post adds to my unease; if so many people are engaging with it, maybe there’s truth to it? But then again, the mixed comments make me wonder if the data is being exaggerated or taken out of context.
B. Communication with Others:
I’d probably message my clinician first: “Hi, I saw a video online warning about Medex and liver risks. Can you clarify if this is something I should worry about?” I might also ask friends or family if they’ve heard anything similar. Discussing it with them could help me gauge whether this is a known concern or just sensationalism.  
C. Deciding Trustworthiness:  
I’d compare sources:  
- Is Dr. Miles credible beyond his follower count? Does he cite specific studies or just show snippets?  
- What do reputable medical websites (e.g., Mayo Clinic, NHS) say about Medex?  
- Are the journal articles he referenced peer-reviewed, or is he cherry-picking data?  
The fact that comments are divided suggests the issue isn’t black-and-white, so I’d dig deeper.  
D. Checks/Actions Before Deciding:
1. Search for Medex + “liver risk” to see if other experts echo the warning.  
2. Check the prescribing leaflet for side effects—does it mention liver issues?  
3. Look up Dr. Miles’ background. Is he known for alarmist content or balanced takes?  
4. Consider my own health: Do I have liver concerns? Is the benefit of headache relief worth potential risks?  

Final Decision:  
For now, I’ll hold off on taking Medex until I hear back from my clinician. If they confirm the risks are minimal based on broader evidence, I’ll proceed cautiously. If not, I’ll ask for alternatives. Trusting a single viral video feels risky, but so does ignoring it entirely—so I’ll prioritize expert advice over online buzz.

Next, I need to think practically. How do I know which reviews to trust? Food poisoning reviews can happen at any restaurant, even top ones. Sometimes people post exaggerated stuff when they’re mad. I should check if these complaints are recent and clustered together (which could mean a real problem), or if they’re random and months apart. If most reviews are still positive overall, that’s a sign the place is generally fine.

I’ll quickly jump back onto Google and Yelp, maybe even look up their Instagram to see if any diners are posting stories today—do they seem happy? Also, I’ll search for any recent health inspection reports online. Usually if there’s a serious issue, it would show up there.

Before panicking, I think I’d message my clinician—maybe send them the video link and ask, “Hey, I just came across this post about Medex. Is this something I should be worried about? Have you heard of any new research on liver risks?” I trust their medical opinion more than someone online, even if that person is a GP. But I still want to check—sometimes new studies come out that not every doctor sees right away.

As for figuring out what’s trustworthy, I’d want to actually look at the articles Dr Miles cited, myself. Are these real peer-reviewed studies from reputable journals? Are they case reports, large-scale trials, or just speculative editorials? And are the risks relevant to someone like me—taking Medex for headaches occasionally—or are they talking about people who take it daily for years?

I’d also check official sources: maybe go on the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) website or check other medical guidelines to see if any updated warnings about Medex have been posted.

Reason

The credibility of information is weighed: The generally high praise from professional food critics weighs far more than a few unverified, anonymous Google negative reviews (especially those that have been ""carefully"" selected).
Urgency and feasibility: With only three hours left until dinner, it is almost impossible to guarantee finding a place of good quality and with a seat when changing locations at the last minute. The greater possibility is to cancel the entire celebration or end up in a worse restaurant.
Sunk cost consideration: That non-refundable deposit is no small amount. It feels so frustrating to lose this sum of money for nothing after friend A gave up.
The credibility of Friend A: His previous disappearance and lack of help, coupled with this sudden last-minute panic, make it hard for people to take his ""warning"" too seriously.
Risk mitigation measures: We will pay more attention at that time - order thoroughly cooked dishes, observe the atmosphere of the restaurant, and avoid the high-risk foods mentioned in the comments. If others seem suspicious, I will quietly remind everyone.","Here’s my unfiltered thought process after watching the video:

​​A. Immediate Emotional/Gut Reaction:​​
""Ugh, why now? Just when I felt relieved about finally having a solution for these headaches... This video instantly spikes my anxiety. The images of medical journals look legit, and he’s a real doctor with a big following—but is he exaggerating for clicks? I feel torn: my own doctor seemed so confident, yet this warning about ‘serious long-term liver risks’ is terrifying. Am I choosing between crippling headaches or ruining my liver? Why didn’t my doctor mention this? Now I’m second-guessing everything.""

​​B. What I’d Say to Clinician/Family:​​

​​To my doctor:​​ ""Hi Dr. [Name], I saw a viral video by a GP claiming Medex has significant liver risks not widely disclosed. Can we discuss this? Are the studies he cites credible?""
​​To a trusted friend/family:​​ ""Freaking out a bit—just got prescribed Medex, but this popular online doctor says it’s dangerous. What would you do? Feels like medical whiplash...""
​​C. Deciding What’s Trustworthy:​​

​​Source Motive & Credibility:​​
Is Dr. Miles genuinely warning people or chasing viral engagement? Check his past content—does he often make alarmist claims?
GP ≠ specialist: Is he a hepatologist or just citing studies he might misinterpret?
​​Evidence vs. Emotion:​​
He showed ‘journal images’—but were they screenshots of full studies or cherry-picked excerpts? Did he share journal names/dates so I can verify?
Clinical trials backing my doctor involved thousands; his ""evidence"" might be tiny outlier studies.
​​Consensus Check:​​
Do major health bodies (FDA, NHS) flag this risk? If it’s truly widespread, why isn’t it on Medex’s label?
​​Comments Aren’t Data:​​
Mixed comments mean nothing—crowds aren’t peer review.
​​D. Checks/Actions Before Deciding:​​

​​Cross-Check Official Sources:​​
Pull Medex’s FDA/EMA safety leaflet → scan for liver warnings.
Search PubMed for recent meta-analyses on Medex + liver risk (not single studies).
​​Contextualize the Risk:​​
How ""serious"" is serious? 1 in 100,000? Or 1 in 10? Are high doses/long-term use required?
Could risks apply to me? (e.g., I don’t drink alcohol, which often compounds liver strain.)
​​Consult My Doctor (Non-Negotiable):​​
Forward the video/link and ask: ""Can you address this specifically?""
​​Short-Term Safeguard:​​
If headaches are unbearable tonight, take half the dose while I investigate—avoid full commitment.
​​Final Decision & Why:​​
​​I’LL START TAKING MEDEX—BUT MONITOR CLOSELY & VERIFY WITH MY DOCTOR.​​

​​Why:​​

​​Trust Hierarchy:​​ My doctor’s direct clinical judgment + large-scale trial data outweigh a GP’s social media post—unless evidence emerges that contradicts this.
​​Benefit/Risk Calculus:​​ My headaches significantly impact my life; the proven benefit outweighs a theoretical long-term risk. OTC status implies safety for most users.
​​Mitigation Plan:​​
Immediately email my doctor with the video and request follow-up.
Start at the lowest effective dose.
Get baseline liver blood tests now and repeat in 3 months.

I’ll start by looking at the Google reviews myself. Are there multiple recent reports of food poisoning or just one or two random comments? I’ll also check the dates — maybe the issue was months ago and already resolved. Then I’ll search the restaurant’s name in local news or social media to see if anything serious was reported.

Given the restaurant’s strong reputation with food critics and how late it is to find alternatives, I’m leaning toward keeping the booking. But to be safe, I’ll call the restaurant directly and ask if they’re aware of any recent complaints. If they’re transparent and confident, I’ll feel better about sticking to the plan.

I would probably send the video to my doctor with a message like: “Hi, I just saw this — should I be worried?” I might also bring it up in a family group chat to see if anyone else has heard of these risks. But I also know social media can blow things out of proportion, and not everything online is accurate.

To decide what’s trustworthy, I’d look up the actual journal articles shown in the video, if possible, and see what the studies really say. I’d also check if any official health organizations like the TGA or FDA have issued warnings about Medex. Dr Miles might be right — but he could also be selectively presenting information for views.

Before I make a final decision, I’ll call my GP and ask about the risks and whether anything’s changed since the clinical trials. I’ll also ask if there’s an alternative to Medex that’s just as effective but with less controversy.

Final decision: I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now until I speak directly with my doctor. I want to be sure I’m not putting my liver at risk unnecessarily, but I also don’t want to jump to conclusions based on social media panic.

I would probably check if there are any undisclosed advertisements in the food critic reviews, as well as check whether the negative google reviews have anything in common (food poisoning associated with a specific dish). ultimately, I would keep the booking, because there probably isn't another restaurant open, and I'm annoyed at friend a for only helping at the last second.

I'd also probably look into the comments who say that the data is being misrepresented. it's dangerous to fully trust people online- especially this doctor. there's biases in psychology that I learnt about, which makes us trust online actors more than we should, so I definitely wouldn't be quick to fully trust this online doctor.

Okay, breathe. Let me look at the screenshots they sent. Yeah, a couple of people are complaining about food poisoning, but I also remember reading reviews from actual food critics who raved about this place. It’s not like every restaurant has perfect reviews even good places can have the occasional bad night. Still, I should double-check. I’ll quickly look up more recent reviews, maybe on a few different platforms like TripAdvisor or even Instagram to see if anyone’s posting about it tonight.

Also, I’ll call the restaurant not to cancel, just to ask a few questions casually. Like what their food safety rating is or if they’ve had any recent complaints. If anything seemed sketchy, I’d feel it.

As for Friend A, I’m tempted to just ignore the message, but I’ll keep it civil. Something like: “I’ve seen some great critic reviews and checked the food safety rating everything looks good. Given the short notice and non-refundable deposit, we’re still going. I hope you’ll come!”

At the same time, I know social media can blow things out of proportion. Just because someone has a big following doesn't mean everything they say is balanced or up to date. Still, it makes me hesitate. I think I’ll message my doctor and ask directly about what Dr Miles said maybe even include a link to the video. Something like, “Hi, I came across this post saying Medex could have serious long-term effects on the liver. Is this something I should be worried about?”

I’ll also check the official health websites like the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) or even look up the medical articles Dr Miles flashed on screen, if I can find them.

Upon reading Friend A's message, my immediate gut - reaction is one of annoyance. I mean, where were they when I was struggling to find a restaurant on my own after they ghosted me? Now, just three hours before the dinner, they pop up with this alarming news.

Right away, I'd be tempted to text Friend A back saying, ""You went radio - silent on me when I needed help, and now you come up with this? How reliable are these Google Reviews anyway?"" I'm skeptical because I remember the restaurant has great reviews from professional food critics. Food critics usually have more in - depth knowledge and experience in evaluating restaurants compared to random diners on Google Reviews.

To decide which information is trustworthy, I'd consider the source. Food critics are likely to have visited the restaurant, tasted the food properly, and made a more objective assessment. On the other hand, Google Reviews can be subjective, and it's possible that those who claimed to get food poisoning had other factors contributing to their illness.

Before making a final decision, I'd do some extra checks. I'd try to find more recent reviews on other platforms like Yelp or TripAdvisor. I'd also look for any official health inspection reports of the restaurant. If I can't find any red flags from these additional sources, and considering that most nearby venues are full, I'd probably stick with the original booking. After all, I've already paid a non - refundable deposit, and the positive reviews from food critics give me some confidence in the restaurant's quality.","Watching Dr Miles' video first made me anxious—my doctor said Medex was safe, but this warning about liver risks felt alarming.

I feel a bit of panic too — what if the reviews are legit? I don’t want to risk getting anyone sick, especially not Friend B on their birthday. But also… I booked this place, I paid the deposit, and I remember reading solid reviews from food critics. I trusted those more than random one-star complaints.

I text Friend A back: “I appreciate the heads-up, but this is super last-minute. I read plenty of positive reviews, including critic ones. Did you find an alternative that isn’t fully booked?” I’m trying to stay civil, even though I’m seething.

To double-check, I Google the restaurant again and look at multiple review sites — not just Google, but also TripAdvisor and maybe even Reddit or any recent local food blogs. I also check the dates on the bad reviews: were they clustered together? From years ago? If there’s a legit pattern of recent food poisoning, I’ll consider switching.

If nothing looks alarming, I’m sticking with the booking. I won’t risk throwing the whole night into chaos based on one message three hours out.

It’s not just someone ranting — he’s calm, he’s got credentials, and he’s citing journal articles. That part grabs me. My first instinct is confusion and a bit of anxiety. My doctor told me Medex was safe and had minimal side effects. I was ready to start it tonight… and now I’m wondering if I’ve missed something big.

I screenshot the video and send it to my GP with a short message: “Hey, I saw this online — any thoughts? Just want to double check before I start Medex.” I’m not trying to be disrespectful, but I also want to be sure. At the same time, I message a friend who’s a pharmacist and ask if they’ve heard anything about Medex and liver damage.

To sort out who to trust, I ask myself: What’s the source? My GP has seen my full medical history and prescribed Medex based on that. Dr Miles might be legit, but social media doesn’t give the full context. I try to find the actual journal articles mentioned in the video — if I can read the abstract or conclusion myself, I might see if the claims are overblown or cherry-picked.

Next, I check the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) site or any government health sources to see what they say about Medex’s side effects. If liver issues were a real risk, I’d expect it to be listed somewhere official, not just in a viral video.

In the end, I decide to hold off on taking Medex tonight — not because I’m convinced it’s dangerous, but because I want to clarify things first.

Take the initiative to reduce risks: After arriving at the venue, observe the hygiene conditions, avoid consuming raw food or high-risk dishes, and ensure a safe gathering.","First and foremost, I trust the professional advice of my attending physician, as he is familiar with my specific situation.

I felt really annoyed because I had asked for their help a month ago and they ignored me. Now, just three hours before dinner, they suddenly bring this up.
Even though I was upset, I’d probably hold back and reply with something like, “Really? I remember seeing a lot of good reviews before,” just to stay calm on the surface.

Next, I would immediately check Google and other review platforms myself to see if there were more recent reports about food poisoning or if it was just one or two random bad reviews.
I’d also go back to see what the professional food critics said, since I remember this restaurant being highly rated.
If possible, I would message a friend who has been there recently and ask about their experience.
At the same time, I’d look to see if there’s any chance of finding another restaurant at short notice, though three hours before dinner is really tight.

Could this medicine really harm my liver?”
I felt a wave of doubt, because my doctor seemed so confident earlier today that Medex was safe and effective.

My first instinct is to send a message to my doctor: “I just saw a video saying Medex could harm the liver—should I be worried?” I’d probably also share it with a close friend and ask, “Have you heard anything like this before?”

Before making any decisions, I would try to figure out whether this information is reliable. Social media videos can be misleading, so I would look up the journal articles that Dr. Miles showed in the video to see if they were recent, well-respected studies or taken out of context. I might also check trusted medical websites or call a pharmacy for professional advice.

In the end, I would still choose to trust my doctor and start taking Medex, but I would keep monitoring and ask more questions at my next appointment. My decision is based on the fact that my doctor knows my personal health history, while a short social media video doesn’t tell the full scientific story.

However, I still feel frustrated because it would be invalidating for the friend who planned everything and put in a non-refundable deposit. 

b. I'd tell her I understand and try to communicate with her that I had already paid a non-refundable deposit and possibly that case of food poisoning could be an anomaly and one-time event. Especially since when restaurants are notified of potential risk, they would change their ways and be more cautious to prevent public criticism and  risk inducing a poor reputation. 

c. Depends on the quantity; for instance, if there were multiple Google reviews, I would be understanding. However, it is very common for restaurants to have incidents here and there all the time. And it depends on how recent the review was, etc. 

D. I'd call the restaurant to ask if they've implemented any risk management procedures and if they were aware of a food poisoning incident. 

I'd be open to looking for an alternative; however, it is purely dependent on circumstance. For instance, if there are  no bookings left, I'd go to my original plan, and if only one customer had reported food poisoning from a restaurant that is highly regarded by food critics, it probably is a restaurant that would most likely prevent further issues from occurring.

I searched for the article Miles had cited, and it was indeed real, but the study was based on a small sample and used much higher doses than what I had been prescribed. I also looked up responses from other medical professionals online—some agreed with Miles, but others argued he had exaggerated the risks.

To be safe, I called my doctor the next morning. She patiently explained that the liver concerns were extremely rare and mostly related to long-term overuse. She also offered to run regular liver function tests if I was worried.

I’d probably message my doctor — something like: “Hey, I came across a video by Dr Herbert Miles warning about liver damage from Medex. Is there truth to this? Should I be concerned?” I might also ask a pharmacist I trust or check in with a friend who’s studying medicine, just to get more perspectives.

As for figuring out what to trust — I’d want to look at the actual journal articles Dr Miles flashed in the video. Are they peer-reviewed? Recent? Are they large-scale human trials or obscure animal studies? And is Dr Miles interpreting them accurately, or cherry-picking scary data? I’d also check what reputable health bodies like the TGA (in Australia) or FDA (if this were the U.S.) have said about Medex. If they haven’t issued any serious warnings, that would give me some reassurance.

Before deciding, I’d look for any official responses to Dr Miles’ claims — maybe medical associations or other doctors have weighed in. If it still feels murky, I might ask for an alternative or delay starting the medication until I have clarity.

I’d hold off on starting Medex until I get a clearer answer from my doctor. My headaches are recurring, but not urgent enough to risk potential long-term liver damage — if that risk is real.

Social media incentivises dramatic content that gets engagement. The fact that he's ""warning"" about risks that patients ""aren't informed about"" sounds like typical fear-mongering language.
The mixed comments are telling - if other medical professionals are saying the data is misrepresented, that's a red flag. I should look up these journal articles myself rather than trust his interpretation. Are they recent? High-quality studies? Is he showing the full context or just cherry-picked excerpts?
My prescribing doctor would have access to comprehensive safety data and prescribing guidelines. They're also accountable to medical boards, unlike social media influencers. I'll ring their surgery tomorrow to discuss liver risks specifically, but I'm not going to panic based on one viral video.

Now, suddenly, they show up with a screenshot of a negative Google review claiming someone got food poisoning?

At first, I panicked. But then I reminded myself why I chose this restaurant in the first place. It had amazing reviews from trusted food critics, a high rating overall, and a strong reputation. I decided to investigate further before reacting. I called the restaurant to ask if they had received any recent complaints—they hadn’t. I also looked up the restaurant’s health inspection record and found no issues.

I was even beginning to feel optimistic I might be able to control my chronic headaches. However, that it might give you serious long-term liver damage was another story.

I decided not to panic. Instead, I looked deeper. Read the article Dr. Miles shared in this video Note that it is actually published in a reputable medical journal For sure I encountered studies like Subramanian et al that did not jive with his claims but he also discovered a study or two that supported the safety of Medex. I message my doctor asking about the long term risks.

I ultimately decided to take the Medex route after giving both points of view a good think, but I made sure to tread lightly.

If Wikipedia didn't mention anything about real possible or claimed serious side effects, I might go and check out those journal articles myself (since my university gets me access to most journals).

If the journal articles really do support Dr Miles' claim I would discuss it with my doctor again before deciding whether to take it.

They ignored my texts a month ago when I asked for help with booking, and now—three hours before the dinner—they suddenly want to question the choice? That feels both inconsiderate and unhelpful. I want to tell them, “You could have raised this much earlier,” but I also know getting into an argument right now will not solve the problem.

I remind myself that I chose this restaurant after reading several positive professional reviews from trusted food critics. One or two bad Google Reviews do not necessarily mean the place is unsafe; sometimes online reviews are exaggerated or even fake. Still, food safety is important, so I would quickly check recent official health inspection reports online and scan multiple review platforms to see if there’s a genuine pattern of complaints.

Given the time constraints, the fact that I’ve paid a non-refundable deposit, and that the majority of sources praise the restaurant’s quality, I decide to keep the booking. I believe the information I originally trusted remains more reliable than a couple of negative online comments, especially on such short notice.","When I first watch Dr Miles’s video, my immediate reaction is concern — the phrase “serious long-term risk to liver health” feels alarming, especially when paired with medical journal images. At the same time, I feel a degree of scepticism; dramatic online warnings often attract attention, and I know that context can be missing or misrepresented.

My instinct is to message my doctor before making any decision: “I’ve just seen a video from Dr Herbert Miles claiming Medex causes long-term liver damage. Could you please confirm whether this is accurate and if it changes your recommendation?” I might also share the link so they can review the exact content.

To decide whose information is more trustworthy, I would look at the original studies Dr Miles cites — checking whether they are peer-reviewed, how large the sample sizes are, and whether conclusions match his claims. I would also research official health authority statements and consult reputable medical websites for balanced summaries.

Before starting the medication, I would also consider arranging a second opinion, ideally from another GP or pharmacist, to see if there is any consensus.

My final decision would be to delay starting Medex until I receive clarification from my doctor and can confirm whether the safety concerns are legitimate. The potential health risk — if true — outweighs the cost of a short delay, and I prefer to act on confirmed, professional advice rather than potentially misleading online content.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1

I spent time researching, made the reservation, and even paid a non-refundable deposit. Now, with just three hours to go, you send me screenshots about food poisoning? Of course, no restaurant wants something like that to happen—it must’ve been an isolated case. The critics loved this place. And let’s be real: it’s Friday evening, most places are already full. What exactly do you expect me to do now? Cancel everything based on a few bad reviews, risk losing the deposit, and scramble to find a new spot last-minute? It feels like you’re not even considering how much effort I’ve put in. At this point, I’m leaning toward keeping the booking.

Wow, that video was intense. My first reaction? Worry. I trusted my doctor when she said Medex was safe with only mild side effects. Now this well-known GP online is saying it could harm my liver long-term? That’s not something I can ignore, especially when he even showed medical journal screenshots. But then again… people in the comments are saying the data might be exaggerated or taken out of context. That makes me question it too.

I think I’d text my doctor or maybe book a quick call: *“Hey, I just saw a post from Dr Miles about Medex and liver risks. Should I be concerned?”* I don’t want to sound like I’m doubting her—but I also want to make an informed decision. I’d also look up the studies Dr Miles referenced, check if they’re recent, peer-reviewed, and whether the risks were long-term and under what dosage.

To be honest, I don’t fully trust viral social media posts, even if they come from doctors. Information without proper context can easily be misused. So, until I speak to my doctor and maybe even get a second opinion or check my liver history, I’ll hold off on taking Medex. My health is worth double-checking.

Dr. Miles is a practicing GP with lots of followers, but you can't just take his word for it alone.

Plus, some comments say the data was twisted, so that's worth noting—maybe he took things out of context.
Before I decide, I need to do some checks and take action.  First, try to find the original medical journal articles Dr. Miles showed, read them carefully, and see if the study's details and conclusions are really like he said.  Second, check Medex's package insert to see if it mentions anything about long-term liver risks.  Besides that, look up other authoritative medical websites or databases to see if there are more studies and reports on Medex's long-term side effects.
In the end, I decided not to rush into taking Medex.  I'll wait until I've verified all this info and had a good chat with the doctor before making up my mind.

I would begin with searching the medication online, and seeing what the general consensus was - if it seemed like Dr Miles was the only media coming up, and other articles seemed to think it was fine I would probably ignore it/bring it up with my regular doctor at our next appointment, but not specifically make an appointment to ask.
If most things did seem to say it could lead to liver failure, I would probably stop taking it and research other medications that can help with headaches that do not have these side effects, and bring it up with my doctor the next time I went, both to ask their opinion on the media, and to ask about alternatives I could try.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,1

B. I would try to confront Friend A, but I would try to make it civil. 
C. Check if the reviews really say that there is food poisoning or not.
D. I'd probably ask friend A if they had a problem with friend B or with the restaurant's pricing. I would try to recommend other restaurants if they didn't like the place/food/pricing, because we're trying to make a good birthday for friend B.
D. Calming myself down to have a civil conversation with friend A.

I'd try to rationalise and talk it out with friend A first before keeping the booking or changing plans, according to their decision. ","A. I'd probably be wary, but take into account that what people say in social media are not always true.
B. I wouldn't say anything unless there are several pointed studies that actually prove this, but I'd send the post to my family/friends to tell them not to use it until proven otherwise.
C. Medical reports/studies that have been done by trustworthy resources and companies. Since people can say whatever they want in social media.
D. I'd probably not take Medex at this point if it is a fairly newly found drug, but if it's been proven in time that it isn't harmful according to trusthworthy reports, then I'll keep using it.",5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1
