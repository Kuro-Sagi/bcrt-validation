I will ask friend A why she/he didn't reply to my messages before. It wouldn't be a confrontation since I know both will be attending friend B's birthday dinner, and I wouldn't want to risk tension between us, which may ruin the dinner. I'll confront friend B about it in a light-hearted manner, and depending on the truthfulness and apologeticness from his/her response, I'll consider whether I still want to remain close friends with them, or whether it's a stain on their character from my pov.

Afterwards, I'll definitely go check the Google reviews myself to confirm if friend A's information is trustworthy or not. After I get my answers, I'll either refute or agree with friend A, and if the information is as she says, I will change plans, and if it isn't, I'll keep the booking.

Just to add, realistically, we would tell friend B the plans a few days prior, just to see if she/he approves, as it is friend B's birthday, and it will also inform him/her of prior travel plans.","I will be concerned at first, and then question the reliability of the social media GP, because I personally don't trust medical practitioners who are extremely active on social media. 

I will go search for the journal articles myself, and judge whether the data presented is as he says, or overtly distorted by Dr Miles' personal opinions on the drug. I would also see if the article is reliable and peer-reviewed. I might also look at similar articles, and if it is as detrimental as he says, I'll send the articles to my own doctor, and ask for explanations. I'll switch doctors if I believe my own doctor isn't valid after his explanations.

If it isn't the case, and it doesn't pose a serious long-term risk, I'll still probably find another doctor and ask them if they also believe that I can use the drug.

C) I will check with other websites that have review about the restaurant in order to ensure the comments are correct and not made up. If there are any comments that talk about food poisoning, I will avoid to order that particular food.

D) Some extra actions I would take is to only eat light food if there is any cases of food poisoning, therefore, would order cheap and safe food to eat to ensure safety.","A) My immediate reaction would be surprised as the packaging of the product says it has minimal side effects that are mild.

C) To decide if the information is trustworthy or not, I will check with other clinicians about Dr Miles claims about Medex and to check online if any sources agree with his claims. Furthermore, I will check online comments to see what they think about his claims.

R_9nP1v1oCAVi3ZEY,0,3.0,4.0,7.0,67,"I'm feeling annoyed that friend A is criticising the restaurant I picked when they didn't try and find an alternative, and especially because they are bringing this up so last minute. 
I would probably look at the Google reviews myself and see how many and how recent the reviews are that friend A screenshotted. If there were many other similar reviews, I'd probably start looking for an alternative. If there were many reviews, but most were positive and there were very few other similar negative reviews, I would want to still go to the restaurant I picked. I would probably rely on the volume of reviews more than the source, but if there were not many reviews overall, I would weight the food critics reviews as more trustworthy than some random google reviewers.
If I decided to start looking for alternatives, I would message friend A straight away saying sure, we can look for a new place, and ask them if they had any ideas? Then I would find and book somewhere new. I'd message friend A later, probably the next day, explaining that I had to pay a deposit for the first restaurant, and ask if they would agree to pay a portion of the lost deposit. In that message I would also tell them that I was feeling frustrated that they didn't help me find a restaurant in the first place, and I was upset that they assumed I would take on the mental load of organising the dinner for our shared friend.
My choice to keep the booking or change restaurant would be based on the other reviews on google etc that I had read today. I would feel inclined to keep the booking, almost out of spite that friend A didn't help to begin with, but also because I want to trust my research of good restaurants and I believe I'm pretty good at discerning these things.","My immediate reaction is to want more information. I would try and find the journal articles to read myself, and start doing some further research into Medex and see if there are many competing opinions. I'd also watch a few other videos from Dr Miles, and see if his other videos seem reasonable and balanced, or if they seem 'click-baity' and share views that frequently oppose the general opinion from medical journals and other clinicians.
Once I read through the articles he quoted, if I felt the journal was clearly aligned with Dr Miles' interpretation, I would book another appointment with my doctor to discuss. However, it would depend on the Dr that originally prescribed me the drug. For example, I've been seeing my current GP for 10 years and I really trust her as a doctor, and I think her knowledge of me and my health history would mean I easily trust her over another Dr I've never met. But if for some reason I had to see another GP or specialist I didn't know very well, I would be way more likely to take the video from Dr Miles seriously. I would also try and verify his qualifications, and try to get an idea of his reputation in the medical field. 
In this situation, I would do my own research, but only if there was heaps of well documented research that supported Dr Miles, I would trust my own doctor oveer him.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,321.0,244.0,31.13,16.31,3.26,1.0,96.38,84.75,28.56,37.96,29.180000000000003,27.11,18.69,18.85,97.82,90.16,76.64,72.13,60.75,57.79,14.95,17.21,11.21,13.93,8.1,10.25,0.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.28,2.49,0.41,3.74,3.28,17.13,16.39,8.41,4.51,0.62,0.82,10.59,9.84,10.28,8.61,6.23,6.56,9.35,10.66,1.25,0.82,20.87,18.03,8.41,6.15,4.98,6.15,4.36,4.92,4.05,1.64,0.31,2.05,0.0,1.64,34.58,29.51,0.0,0.41,25.86,23.36,7.48,6.15,2.18,2.05,5.3,5.33,5.3,4.92,0.0,1.23,7.48,7.38,0.0,0.0,4.98,2.05,2.8,1.64,2.18,0.41,1.87,0.0,0.62,0.0,1.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.9,9.84,5.3,6.15,0.62,0.41,0.0,2.46,0.62,0.41,0.31,0.0,2.18,0.82,5.61,3.69,0.0,0.0,1.87,0.0,0.0,1.23,0.0,2.05,0.93,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.0,7.170000000000001,3.28,1.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.05,3.28,1.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.49,4.1,0.0,4.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.62,0.82,0.62,0.41,0.31,0.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.18,1.23,9.03,4.1,9.97,8.2,2.18,0.41,1.25,0.0,4.36,4.92,2.8,2.46,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.41,4.67,3.69,6.23,4.92,2.49,1.23,0.0,0.0,0.62,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.28,12.3,3.12,3.69,4.67,5.33,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.18,2.87,0.0,0.41,0.0,0.0,43

I would text Friend A and say, “Thanks for the info. Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” I’d also ask where they found the reviews and when the bad reviews were posted.

To decide if it’s true, I would look at the date of the bad reviews. If they are old, maybe the problem is fixed now. I would also check if many people said the same thing, or just one or two.

I might call the restaurant and ask if they had any food safety problems. If they sound honest and confident, I will feel better.

In the end, I would keep the booking. The deposit is non-refundable, and the critic reviews are still good. I’ll just be extra careful with what I order.

","When I saw the video, I felt confused and a little scared. My doctor said Medex is safe and helps with headaches, but now a popular doctor online says it could hurt my liver in the long run. Who should I believe?

I would send the video to my doctor and ask, “What do you think about this?” I trust my doctor because they know my health history. I would also ask if they have seen those studies before.

To decide what is true, I would look at the sources. Dr Miles shows journal articles, but I don’t know if he is showing all the facts or just the scary parts. Maybe he is trying to get more views online.

Before I take the medicine, I would look up the studies myself and check if real health websites like the government or Mayo Clinic say anything about liver problems.

In the end, I would not take Medex yet. I want to wait until my doctor replies and I know more.

“Hey, I get the concern, but I wish you brought this up earlier when I asked for help. I already paid a non-refundable deposit and the restaurant has great critic reviews too.”

I might glance at the reviews myself just to be sure, but unless the top ten all say “food poisoning,” I’m not worried. Plus, I already paid the deposit and it’s non-refundable, so changing plans now feels like a waste. Everywhere else is probably booked anyway.

I would go in with the plan and message them that it should be fine but I would most likely finalise the plan when we meet up together. If over text they don't mind eating then that would be fine, but if they show some resistance then we would talk it further in person.","It depends on how well I know my doctor, whether I met them for the first time today or our regular family doctor. If they were a doctor I knew well, I doubt they’d casually prescribe something with serious liver risks without mentioning it. 

Additionally, many sources online are inaccurate. Still, I don’t want to ignore it completely. I’ll probably just message my doctor tomorrow or call them and say, “Hey, I saw a video claiming Medex could have long-term liver effects""

As for now, I’ll still take the Medex. I trust the doctor who knows my history and gave me advice face-to-face. If anything sounds off after we talk, I can always stop or switch meds later.

I’ve already paid the deposit, and now, three hours before dinner, they’re raising concerns based on a few random Google reviews?

I’d reply: “Hey, I get your concern, but it’s really last-minute. The place has glowing reviews from food critics, and we booked it because nothing else was available. Why bring this up now?” I’d definitely re-check the reviews — not just the negative ones, but the overall trend. Are the bad reviews recent or isolated? Are they even about the same location?

I’d also quickly search for any official health inspection notices about the restaurant. If there’s no formal warning or consistent red flags, I’d trust the critics and the majority of diners who had positive experiences. Friend A’s timing seems off, and I can’t ignore that they didn’t contribute when it mattered.

In the end, I’d stick with the booking. Changing now would cause chaos, we’d likely lose the money, and it’s too late to rebook somewhere good. I’d tell everyone to show up — and maybe just avoid the oysters.","Whoa… that video has definitely shaken me up a bit. My gut reaction is anxiety — I mean, the doctor seemed confident, but now here’s another qualified doctor saying it could damage my liver long-term? That’s a pretty serious risk to just brush off.

The first thing I’d probably do is message my GP and ask if they’ve seen the video or heard of Dr. Miles. I’d want to hear their take directly, especially since they know my medical history. I might even share the video link with them. At the same time, I’d probably send it to a friend who’s into health science — just to get another view.

To figure out what’s actually trustworthy, I’d look up the journals Dr. Miles referred to. Are those peer-reviewed? Recent? Are his claims taken out of context? I’d also check other official sources — like the TGA or medical sites — to see if there are any warnings or updates about Medex.

Until then, I wouldn’t start the medication. I’d rather deal with headaches for a few more days than risk something irreversible.

Instead of maybe we shouldn’t go… they could’ve suggested something like “let’s not try the fish” or smth more helpful. At this point I would stick with the original booking, but look further into the food poisoning case, hopefully trying to avoid the possibility of us having the same outcome. I’d also express to friend A and ask them if something was going on. I’d also express how I felt abandoned and disappointed that all the responsibility was thrown onto me, and point out that the last minute comment was possibly phrased poorly.","At first my reaction was either dr miles was either doing this for clout, or possibly new research had surfaced, shedding light on the dangers of this drug. In both cases, I’d still seek out a second opinion, and present what I have been told and seen (the video).

I can’t believe they ghosted me back then, and now they’re suddenly worried because of a few Google reviews. This feels so unfair I put in the effort, paid the deposit, and now they want to derail the whole plan.

Okay, breathe. Let me look at the screenshots they sent. Yeah, a couple of people are complaining about food poisoning, but I also remember reading reviews from actual food critics who raved about this place. It’s not like every restaurant has perfect reviews even good places can have the occasional bad night. Still, I should double-check. I’ll quickly look up more recent reviews, maybe on a few different platforms like TripAdvisor or even Instagram to see if anyone’s posting about it tonight.

Also, I’ll call the restaurant not to cancel, just to ask a few questions casually. Like what their food safety rating is or if they’ve had any recent complaints. If anything seemed sketchy, I’d feel it.

As for Friend A, I’m tempted to just ignore the message, but I’ll keep it civil. Something like: “I’ve seen some great critic reviews and checked the food safety rating everything looks good. Given the short notice and non-refundable deposit, we’re still going. I hope you’ll come!”

Bottom line: we’re going. Friend B deserves a proper celebration, and this was the best option we had. I’ve done my homework.","Liver damage? That’s not what my doctor said at all. This is kind of scary. I was feeling okay about taking Medex, especially since my doctor seemed confident it was safe and even said side effects were mild. But now I’m seeing this video from Dr Miles and he’s an actual GP with journal articles backing him up? I don’t want to mess around with my liver, especially if there’s a real risk.

At the same time, I know social media can blow things out of proportion. Just because someone has a big following doesn't mean everything they say is balanced or up to date. Still, it makes me hesitate. I think I’ll message my doctor and ask directly about what Dr Miles said maybe even include a link to the video. Something like, “Hi, I came across this post saying Medex could have serious long-term effects on the liver. Is this something I should be worried about?”

I’ll also check the official health websites like the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) or even look up the medical articles Dr Miles flashed on screen, if I can find them. If the articles are real and recent, that might mean there's more to this than what my doctor first told me. I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now, at least until I’ve cleared this up properly.

I would also tell her that I already paid the deposit for this restaurant and that it is non-refundable. If the food critic review is in a form of video in social media, I would send her the link so that Friend A can see, but if it is in the form of text, I would just send her a screenshot of the proof that I researched about the restaurant before booking. I would believe food critics as I am sure that these critics must have tasted every food in every restaurants which I'm sure if they said its good then it must be very good. Eventually, I would keep the booking as most of the restaurants with good food must be very packed already especially for walk-ins.

After seeing that video, I would message my doctor and send him the link of the video, and asked if what the video is saying is correct or not to make sure. I would certainly not only ask the doctor, I would go to the nearest pharmacy and ask the pharmacist if whatever the video is saying correct or not.

I chased them up, they ghosted me, and I ended up doing everything myself; finding the place, reading reviews, paying the deposit out of my own pocket. And it’s non-refundable too. I remember this place had a good write-up in that food magazine and most of the Google reviews were fine. There were a couple of bad ones, but seriously, every restaurant has a few horror stories. It doesn’t mean it’s a death trap.

Also, even if we wanted to change restaurants now, it’s a Saturday night. . I get being cautious, but this just feels like them trying to avoid responsibility again. Honestly, unless someone else wants to fork out hundreds of dollars for a new place and sort a backup plan within the next hour, we’re sticking to the original restaurant. I’m not throwing away the effort I put in or the money","Okay, that video really caught me off guard. I just got prescribed Medex today, and my doctor said it’s safe with only mild side effects. But now Dr. Herbert Miles, who seems credible and has a big following, is warning about serious long-term liver risks? And he even showed medical journal images to back it up. That’s pretty worrying. But then again, the comments are mixed, like some people say the data might be misrepresented, so maybe it’s not as clear-cut as he makes it seem.

I don’t want to ignore a potential risk, especially something serious like liver damage. But I also don’t want to panic over social media claims without solid proof. I think I should check with my doctor again and maybe bring up this video and ask for their perspective on these concerns. In the meantime, I’ll probably hold off on taking Medex until I get more clarity.

B. I'd probably say something like ""ok, maybe we could ask the group what they think? Just a bit scared we won't be able to get a booking anywhere else this late...""
C. Food critic reviews seem more trustworthy, but also to me any reviews indicating food poisoning would plant a slight seed of doubt, that doesn't tend to be something people lie about. 
D. I'd probably read the reviews for myself and see if they seem truthful. 

I'd probably change the plans provided we could get a booking somewhere else, but if not wouldn't cancel as long as the groups okay with it.

","A. Immediate gut reaction would be confusion, maybe slightly scared that that information could be correct, and that i hadn't heard anything at all about liver effects from my doctor. 
B. Probably nothing - might potentially mention it to my doctor at my next appointment, but wouldn't actively try and contact them outside of that. 
C. I would definitely do some digging into that article about liver damage, and check if its from a trustworthy journal (peer reviewed etc) and maybe look into what the actual stats were in terms of people who had liver complications. 

Honeslty, I would probably end up ignoring the video - for 2 main reasons: 
1. even if it is correct and there is a chance of liver complications, if my doctor hasn't discussed it i'm sure that chance is incredibly small and not something worth worrying about especially if the medicine is proving effective in treating the headaches. 
2. I have no idea what the qualifications of some random dr online are, and would have to do some more research to look into the validity of the journal article. 

Even if initially i might be slightly scared that i could experience liver complications, i think looking into the stats would reassure me either that this wasn't the case or that it was a very small possibility, so in either case i would probably just proceed with my drs recommended course of treatment.

I replied to A and asked, “Where did you see this review? Is it recent? Just one person said they got food poisoning—was it serious?” I also checked Google Reviews myself. Most of them were very good. I even found some new reviews from this week that said the food was great.

To be safe, I called the restaurant and asked if they had any recent issues with food safety. They told me everything was fine, and no one else complained. That made me feel more confident.

Since I already paid a non-refundable deposit and there is no solid proof the restaurant is dangerous, I decided to stick with the plan. I trust the overall good reviews and the restaurant’s response. Changing now would be too late and too stressful.","When I saw the video by Dr. Miles, I felt nervous and confused. The idea of long-term liver damage sounded scary, especially since my doctor didn’t mention it. I started to wonder: Did my doctor miss something? Or is the video exaggerating?

I sent the video to my doctor and asked, “What do you think about this? Should I be worried?” I also talked to my older sister, who’s a pharmacist. She told me to look at the actual research articles, not just social media posts.

So I searched online and found one of the studies Dr. Miles showed. It did mention liver effects, but only in very rare cases with very high doses. I also found that Medex has been approved by medical authorities and used safely by many patients.

In the end, I decided to take the medicine, but I will follow the doctor’s instructions carefully and do a liver check-up after a month. I think that’s a balanced and safe choice.",3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,3 = Uncertain,1,1.0,1.0,167.0,164.0,9.15,34.12,10.7,3.53,87.84,92.92,57.69,5.3,11.13,12.62,16.17,17.07,97.01,92.07,77.84,75.0,59.28,53.66,17.96,15.85,11.98,11.59,8.38,9.76,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.61,0.0,0.61,2.99,0.0,5.99,4.27,13.77,13.410000000000002,5.99,7.93,1.2,0.61,6.59,10.37,9.58,7.93,9.58,6.1,7.78,9.15,1.8,1.22,19.16,20.12,8.38,7.93,5.39,3.66,3.59,1.83,1.8,0.61,1.8,0.0,0.0,1.22,34.13,23.78,2.99,0.0,11.98,14.019999999999998,5.39,6.1,2.99,1.83,0.6,0.61,1.2,2.44,0.0,0.0,1.8,3.05,0.0,0.0,8.98,3.05,5.39,0.61,2.99,2.44,4.19,2.44,1.8,0.0,1.8,2.44,0.6,1.83,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.57,9.15,7.78,5.49,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.99,5.49,4.79,3.05,0.0,0.61,0.6,0.0,0.0,1.22,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,1.83,5.39,4.27,1.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.4,4.27,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.79,7.32,0.6,5.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.8,0.61,0.0,1.22,7.19,3.05,3.59,6.71,0.6,1.22,0.0,0.0,1.2,3.05,1.2,1.83,0.0,0.61,0.6,0.61,8.38,5.49,13.77,10.98,4.19,2.44,1.2,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.17,19.51,5.99,6.71,3.59,4.88,2.4,2.44,0.6,0.0,1.8,2.44,1.8,3.05,0.0,0.0,50

The time stamps matter as well, because i'd look at how long ago the critiques were made, and when the reviews were made. Now i'd also look into the dishes in the review that caused the food poisoning, and would see if it's something easily irritable to the stomach. If there were no dishes mentioned, i'd check the other reviews of the person who wrote the google review to see if it was similar.

If I do feel doubt, I would try and check the linked articles in the video for myself first and see if the side effects impacted the majority or the minority, the sample etc, how the experiment or trial was conducted, and why that could be the case.

I would tell them that it's non-refundable and we would have to attend as it's inconsiderate to change plans right before the event. 

I would offer an ultimatum, if friend A is able to find an alternative restaurant and pay their share (the full fee) of the booking, we could consult with friend B and find an alternative place instead. The chances of that it unlikely though as it's hard to negotiate and find alternative time and place again. 

In regards to the restaurants review, if the OVERALL impression of the restaurant is good then it's best to attend it either way. The likely hood of food poisoning is rare and it applies for EVERY restaurant. 

Personally, I would've stuck with the same booking if the Friend A isn't willing to pay for the full fee on the alternative restaurant.

Up front (in-person) consultation with a certified doctor is my only reliable source, i can discuss with them about the consequences and bad influences of this medication which I've heard from social media. Rather than leaving those worries unattended, I can discuss with a doctor for them to give better clarification. 

Most of the time, social media is used to express the extremities of certain scenarios for entertainment, it's best to have it clarified with a professional in person.

I would also feel a bit angry as I was the one helping plan the outing a month ago, with friend B being unresponsive then and suddenly very responsive now about their opinions about the restaurant booking.

B, I would text back in a calm but logical manner saying that their opinions are slightly last minute and that I have already paid a deposit for the booking. I would also tell them that the 'food poisoning' incident could have been a one off thing, or some random customers writing false reviews. 

C, I would trust the information of food critics, knowing the fact that they review restaurants as a career, and thus have creditable titles. 

D, Before we make a final decision, I would do a google search myself, about the reviews for the restaurant, and if the most recent reviews are rated on the higher side, I would text the friend and tell them this information. If it turned out that Friend A was right, where a bulk of the recent reviews for the restaurant were about food poisoning, then I would either just tank the deposit, or ask that friend to split the deposit (seeing that they were unresponsive about the celebrations a month ago, and that they still have some responsibility over the planning) - I would also do some quick searches for other restaurants. 

Overall, I would keep the booking, seeing that other nearby venues are full and it would be too last minute to change anything. 
","A, Initially I would be a bit slightly cautious about the drug, however since I was prescribed the drug by the doctor, I would still consider taking it, especially since not all things on social media can be trusted. 
B, I might tell my friends about the slightly suspicious drug and ask them for advice on whether to take it or not, but other than that, I don't think I would be suspicious enough to trust a random GP on the internet over my actual physical GP. 
C, I think that my gut tells me to follow my actual GP over the GP on the internet, as although Dr Miles says that the drug would pose long term risk to liver health, there may be missing details on what exactly causes this risk such as the dosage or the frequency of taking the drug. Also, although he showed images of medical journal articles, it is easy to find academic or trustworthy looking journals on the internet that support any argument. 
D, I would probably do some quick checks by doing a search on the internet or maybe some forums about the drug, to see if the claims by Dr Miles are true. Also I think that I might look to see if any of the people in my inner circle have tried the drugs and experienced any symptoms. 

Ultimately, I think that if i was really really worried, I would get a second opinion by a different GP or ask the same GP about these claims.

Before making a final decision, I would promptly search for more recent reviews or news articles about the restaurant to ascertain if there have been any recent food safety issues.

Ultimately, I would maintain the original booking at the restaurant. I place more weight on the positive professional reviews and my past positive experiences there than on the last-minute concerns raised by Friend A. I would also monitor everyone's well-being during and after the dinner.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,0,1.0,1.0,170.0,180.0,77.79,80.96,19.18,20.13,90.34,95.07,13.87,6.08,18.89,20.0,30.59,32.22,90.59,89.44,65.29,63.89,51.18,51.67,10.0,10.0,8.24,8.33,5.88,5.56,0.59,1.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.76,1.6699999999999997,1.76,1.6699999999999997,14.71,13.33,9.41,8.33,0.0,0.0,14.12,16.67,7.0600000000000005,6.67,5.29,5.56,7.0600000000000005,7.22,0.59,0.56,12.939999999999998,11.11,8.24,7.78,1.76,2.22,4.71,5.56,2.94,3.33,1.76,2.22,0.0,0.0,30.0,30.0,0.59,0.56,21.18,21.11,7.65,6.67,2.35,2.22,4.12,3.89,5.29,5.0,0.0,0.0,3.53,4.44,0.0,0.0,4.71,4.44,1.76,1.11,2.35,2.78,2.35,2.78,0.59,0.56,1.18,1.6699999999999997,0.0,0.56,1.18,1.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,9.44,4.71,3.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.94,2.78,5.29,5.56,0.0,0.0,1.76,1.6699999999999997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.56,5.88,6.109999999999999,1.76,1.6699999999999997,0.0,0.0,4.12,4.44,0.0,0.56,0.0,0.0,6.469999999999999,5.56,1.76,1.6699999999999997,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.12,3.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.56,1.18,1.6699999999999997,4.12,5.0,7.65,8.33,2.94,1.6699999999999997,1.18,1.11,2.35,5.0,0.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.56,8.82,8.33,2.35,2.22,1.18,1.6699999999999997,2.35,2.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,10.56,5.29,5.0,1.76,2.78,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.76,1.6699999999999997,1.18,1.11,0.0,0.0,54

R_9h5u12dwC5eG2Z6,0,2.0,3.0,5.0,55,"The moment I read Friend A’s message, my first reaction is frustration. They ignored my texts a month ago when I asked for help with booking, and now—three hours before the dinner—they suddenly want to question the choice? That feels both inconsiderate and unhelpful. I want to tell them, “You could have raised this much earlier,” but I also know getting into an argument right now will not solve the problem.

I remind myself that I chose this restaurant after reading several positive professional reviews from trusted food critics. One or two bad Google Reviews do not necessarily mean the place is unsafe; sometimes online reviews are exaggerated or even fake. Still, food safety is important, so I would quickly check recent official health inspection reports online and scan multiple review platforms to see if there’s a genuine pattern of complaints.

Given the time constraints, the fact that I’ve paid a non-refundable deposit, and that the majority of sources praise the restaurant’s quality, I decide to keep the booking. I believe the information I originally trusted remains more reliable than a couple of negative online comments, especially on such short notice.","When I first watch Dr Miles’s video, my immediate reaction is concern — the phrase “serious long-term risk to liver health” feels alarming, especially when paired with medical journal images. At the same time, I feel a degree of scepticism; dramatic online warnings often attract attention, and I know that context can be missing or misrepresented.

My instinct is to message my doctor before making any decision: “I’ve just seen a video from Dr Herbert Miles claiming Medex causes long-term liver damage. Could you please confirm whether this is accurate and if it changes your recommendation?” I might also share the link so they can review the exact content.

To decide whose information is more trustworthy, I would look at the original studies Dr Miles cites — checking whether they are peer-reviewed, how large the sample sizes are, and whether conclusions match his claims. I would also research official health authority statements and consult reputable medical websites for balanced summaries.

Before starting the medication, I would also consider arranging a second opinion, ideally from another GP or pharmacist, to see if there is any consensus.

My final decision would be to delay starting Medex until I receive clarification from my doctor and can confirm whether the safety concerns are legitimate. The potential health risk — if true — outweighs the cost of a short delay, and I prefer to act on confirmed, professional advice rather than potentially misleading online content.",4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,193.0,236.0,46.8,38.71,6.700000000000001,7.17,97.01,71.12,27.06,25.72,21.44,23.6,27.459999999999997,30.51,93.78,85.17,70.47,62.29,50.26,46.61,12.44,10.59,9.33,8.9,7.25,6.36,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.85,0.0,0.42,1.5500000000000005,0.85,3.11,1.69,17.1,12.29,8.29,5.93,2.07,0.85,7.77,8.47,5.700000000000001,8.47,7.25,5.08,7.25,10.59,1.04,0.0,16.58,14.41,9.84,8.47,7.25,4.66,3.63,2.12,2.07,0.85,1.04,0.0,0.52,1.27,31.09,30.93,0.0,0.0,18.65,21.61,8.81,5.93,1.5500000000000005,2.54,2.07,4.24,2.59,4.66,0.52,0.0,3.63,5.08,0.52,0.0,8.81,2.12,4.66,1.27,4.15,0.85,2.07,0.42,0.0,0.0,2.07,0.42,0.0,0.42,1.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.36,9.32,7.25,6.78,1.04,0.85,0.0,1.69,1.04,0.0,1.04,0.42,4.15,2.54,3.11,2.54,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42,2.07,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.07,1.27,5.700000000000001,3.39,1.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.63,2.97,1.04,0.42,0.0,0.0,3.11,4.66,0.52,3.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.04,0.0,0.52,0.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.04,2.12,0.0,0.42,8.29,2.97,6.22,5.93,2.07,2.12,0.52,0.0,2.07,1.69,1.04,2.12,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.85,8.29,6.78,5.18,0.85,4.15,5.93,0.52,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.99,13.98,4.15,3.81,5.18,5.08,0.52,0.42,0.0,0.0,2.07,0.85,2.07,3.81,0.0,0.0,71

My first thought is pure frustration—where were they when I was scrambling to find a place, putting down my own money for the deposit? Now, three hours before dinner, they’re suddenly an expert with Google Reviews?
I should do a quick check: maybe look up the restaurant’s health inspection score online. Most places post that, and it’s a solid indicator. Also, text Friend B—maybe they’ve heard anything about the spot? But I don’t want to panic them. And, nearby venues are full. If we cancel, we might end up with no place for B’s birthday. The deposit is non-refundable, so that’s money down the drain.
I’ll keep the booking. The critics’ reviews are more trustworthy, the timing is too tight to change, and Friend A’s sudden concern feels unearned. I’ll mention the health check to ease any worries, but we’re going.","Watching that video by Dr. Miles, my heart instantly sank.  The doctor clearly said Medex has really mild side effects, so where did this sudden talk of long-term liver damage come from? My mind was a mess—if I don't take it, I'm scared the headaches will keep coming nonstop;  but if I do take it, I'm worried it'll really mess up my liver.  This conflicting, anxious feeling is just awful.
I send my doctor a message right away.  I'll say, ""Doc, I just saw Dr. Miles saying Medex has a serious long-term risk to the liver, and he even attached pics of medical journal articles.  That's not what you told me before, and I'm kinda worried.  Wondering what's going on here?""  Also, I wanna chat with my friend who's a doctor, ask if she knows anything about Dr. Miles or those journal articles he mentioned.
Figuring out if this info is trustworthy takes some thinking.  The doctor recommended it based on clinical trial results.  Clinical trials are usually strictly designed and monitored, with a pretty big sample size, so their results should be pretty reliable.  Dr. Miles is a practicing GP with lots of followers, but you can't just take his word for it alone.  Those medical journal articles he talked about—gotta check if they're published in reputable journals, if the study's sample size and design are scientific, and if the conclusions are backed up by enough data.  Plus, some comments say the data was twisted, so that's worth noting—maybe he took things out of context.
Before I decide, I need to do some checks and take action.  First, try to find the original medical journal articles Dr. Miles showed, read them carefully, and see if the study's details and conclusions are really like he said.  Second, check Medex's package insert to see if it mentions anything about long-term liver risks.  Besides that, look up other authoritative medical websites or databases to see if there are more studies and reports on Medex's long-term side effects.
In the end, I decided not to rush into taking Medex.  I'll wait until I've verified all this info and had a good chat with the doctor before making up my mind.  After all, this is about my health, especially an important organ like the liver.  Can't be careless—gotta get a clear picture of the risks first.",3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1 = Extremely Uncharacteristic,2 = Somewhat Uncharacteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,3 = Uncertain,4 = Somewhat Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,164.0,396.0,32.47,29.97,43.65,8.2,94.28,77.17,37.8,20.23,10.93,17.22,15.85,19.19,91.46,88.64,66.46,70.71,54.27,52.53,13.410000000000002,14.39,10.98,8.84,6.1,5.56,1.83,0.0,0.61,0.51,0.0,1.7699999999999998,2.44,0.7599999999999999,2.44,5.56,15.24,13.64,9.15,5.56,1.22,0.7599999999999999,9.76,11.36,12.2,9.34,7.32,6.82,7.32,8.59,1.22,1.26,18.29,19.95,6.71,6.57,4.27,5.56,6.1,1.7699999999999998,4.88,1.01,0.61,0.25,1.22,0.51,31.100000000000005,27.27,0.61,0.51,12.2,14.900000000000002,3.66,3.5399999999999996,0.61,1.5199999999999998,1.83,1.26,3.66,5.05,0.0,1.01,1.83,5.05,0.0,0.0,4.88,4.55,3.05,2.27,1.83,2.27,1.83,1.5199999999999998,0.0,0.25,1.83,1.26,1.22,1.01,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.98,8.59,3.66,4.55,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.51,1.83,3.79,7.32,3.79,0.0,0.0,1.83,0.25,0.0,0.25,0.0,1.5199999999999998,1.22,0.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.22,0.51,4.88,3.28,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.83,3.03,2.44,0.25,0.0,0.0,3.05,4.8,1.22,3.28,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.22,0.0,0.61,0.0,0.61,0.7599999999999999,0.61,0.25,0.0,2.02,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7599999999999999,1.22,1.5199999999999998,9.15,5.56,14.019999999999998,9.85,3.66,1.26,1.83,1.7699999999999998,6.1,5.56,1.22,2.27,0.61,0.0,1.22,0.25,9.15,3.79,3.05,3.79,9.76,6.06,2.44,2.02,0.61,1.01,0.0,1.01,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,20.45,5.49,6.57,7.32,6.82,3.66,0.51,0.0,0.0,7.32,4.8,1.22,1.7699999999999998,0.0,0.0,68

After all the effort I put in to find and secure the booking—especially when they ghosted me during the planning—this was the last thing I needed. My gut reaction was frustration, but also concern, because food poisoning is serious. I’d reply to Friend A immediately: “That’s worrying—where did you find this review, and how recent is it?”

Before making a decision, I’d check the credibility of the reviews. Were they from verified diners? Were there multiple recent reports, or just an isolated case from months ago? I’d also cross-reference other review platforms and the restaurant’s official social media to see if they’ve addressed any complaints. If possible, I’d call the restaurant directly to ask about the alleged incident.

Given the short notice and the restaurant’s strong critic reviews, if I found the complaints were old or unverified, I’d keep the booking. But if the issue seemed current and genuine, I’d cancel—even if it meant losing the deposit—and quickly search for a backup venue, because everyone’s health is more important than money.
","When I first watched Dr Miles’s video, I felt alarmed and confused. My doctor had reassured me that Medex was safe with only mild side effects, yet here was another medical professional warning about serious liver risks. I immediately thought about my health history and wondered if I might be particularly vulnerable.

I would message my doctor or pharmacist straight away, summarising Dr Miles’s claims and asking for their professional opinion. To decide whose information is more trustworthy, I’d check the credibility of both sources: my prescribing doctor knows my medical history, while Dr Miles’s post might be aimed at the general public. I’d also look up the medical journals he referenced, verify if the studies were peer-reviewed, recent, and relevant to typical Medex dosages.

Before making a decision, I’d seek a second medical opinion and possibly request liver function tests if I decide to proceed with the medication. My final decision would be to delay starting Medex until I get professional clarification, because protecting my long-term health outweighs the urgency of treating my headaches.

B. I would try to confront Friend A, but I would try to make it civil. 
C. Check if the reviews really say that there is food poisoning or not.
D. I'd probably ask friend A if they had a problem with friend B or with the restaurant's pricing. I would try to recommend other restaurants if they didn't like the place/food/pricing, because we're trying to make a good birthday for friend B.
D. Calming myself down to have a civil conversation with friend A.

I'd try to rationalise and talk it out with friend A first before keeping the booking or changing plans, according to their decision. ","A. I'd probably be wary, but take into account that what people say in social media are not always true.
B. I wouldn't say anything unless there are several pointed studies that actually prove this, but I'd send the post to my family/friends to tell them not to use it until proven otherwise.
C. Medical reports/studies that have been done by trustworthy resources and companies. Since people can say whatever they want in social media.
D. I'd probably not take Medex at this point if it is a fairly newly found drug, but if it's been proven in time that it isn't harmful according to trusthworthy reports, then I'll keep using it.",5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,5 = Extremely Characteristic,1,1.0,1.0,112.0,114.0,71.85,4.13,11.66,1.0,29.66,75.54,47.3,20.230000000000004,10.179999999999998,12.669999999999998,18.75,19.3,92.86,92.98,70.54,71.93,56.25,58.77,11.61,19.3,8.93,7.02,5.36,5.26,0.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.68,1.75,2.68,12.28,14.29,9.65,10.71,2.63,0.89,0.0,14.29,10.53,8.93,14.04,2.68,5.26,8.93,9.65,1.7900000000000005,4.39,19.640000000000004,25.44,5.36,1.75,0.89,0.8800000000000001,11.61,3.51,6.25,3.51,5.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.04,36.84,0.0,0.0,27.68,27.19,3.57,3.51,3.57,2.63,8.93,5.26,6.25,7.02,0.89,3.51,8.93,9.65,0.0,0.0,7.14,3.51,4.46,1.75,2.68,1.75,2.68,0.0,1.7900000000000005,0.0,0.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.179999999999998,14.04,6.25,8.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.7900000000000005,0.0,0.0,0.8800000000000001,3.57,7.02,8.93,5.26,0.0,0.8800000000000001,5.36,0.8800000000000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.7900000000000005,3.51,1.7900000000000005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.51,4.46,6.14,1.7900000000000005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.89,6.14,1.7900000000000005,0.8800000000000001,0.0,0.0,4.46,1.75,0.89,1.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8800000000000001,0.0,1.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.75,0.0,0.0,12.5,7.89,4.46,5.26,0.89,0.8800000000000001,0.0,0.0,3.57,4.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.68,4.39,1.7900000000000005,3.51,1.7900000000000005,5.26,0.89,0.8800000000000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.75,19.3,9.820000000000002,7.89,2.68,3.51,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.46,6.14,1.7900000000000005,1.75,0.0,0.0,90
