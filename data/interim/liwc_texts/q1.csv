R_4jkWGYT7ECy8kAR,"I would be quite annoyed that friend A replied so late, and I'll wonder if it was intentional or not. I will ask friend A why she/he didn't reply to my messages before. It wouldn't be a confrontation since I know both will be attending friend B's birthday dinner, and I wouldn't want to risk tension between us, which may ruin the dinner. I'll confront friend B about it in a light-hearted manner, and depending on the truthfulness and apologeticness from his/her response, I'll consider whether I still want to remain close friends with them, or whether it's a stain on their character from my pov. Afterwards, I'll definitely go check the Google reviews myself to confirm if friend A's information is trustworthy or not. After I get my answers, I'll either refute or agree with friend A, and if the information is as she says, I will change plans, and if it isn't, I'll keep the booking. Just to add, realistically, we would tell friend B the plans a few days prior, just to see if she/he approves, as it is friend B's birthday, and it will also inform him/her of prior travel plans."
R_4VJzj3BEMoQSS75,"Hey so that's not really fair, like I get that some google reviews are bad, but you didn't text me back and only now you bring this up? I think we should go, just warn friend B about possible food poisoning, besides, I already paid for a non-refundable deposit and I would hate for it to go to waste. If I didn't have to pay a non-refundable deposit then I'd straight away go to a new restaurant, but you didn't tell me early enough. Truthfully I'd ok with going to another restaurant but i don't know if there would be any spots available since its very late. Also, this restaurant has great reviews from food critics so I think it should be alright, but before I think we should go ask friend B's opinion since it's their birthday. If they want to go to another restaurant then we can go, but I think we should keep the booking for now since the deposit has been paid, we don't have much time until we actually meet up to find another place and there are plenty of good reviews."
R_4EpdmEXYNxaBzKp,"A. I would be shocked and disgusted B. I would we be ""thats so gross but i saw that it had a lot of good reviews and its non non-refundable and I am too broke to book another one"" C. I would trust the ones that say the same thing D. Ill check for other restaurants"
R_4RTXhjjlqGwpjco,"A) I will be surprised as the review list I only saw positive comments about the restaurant. Therefore, my gut reaction would be to find the food poisoning comments. B) I will tell friend A that other restaurants nearby are also already full. And also tell that the restaurant is non-refundable deposit for the booking. However, I will tell friend A that I will check with the comments online to ensure safety when at the restaurant. C) I will check with other websites that have review about the restaurant in order to ensure the comments are correct and not made up. If there are any comments that talk about food poisoning, I will avoid to order that particular food. D) Some extra actions I would take is to only eat light food if there is any cases of food poisoning, therefore, would order cheap and safe food to eat to ensure safety."
R_9nP1v1oCAVi3ZEY,"I'm feeling annoyed that friend A is criticising the restaurant I picked when they didn't try and find an alternative, and especially because they are bringing this up so last minute. I would probably look at the Google reviews myself and see how many and how recent the reviews are that friend A screenshotted. If there were many other similar reviews, I'd probably start looking for an alternative. If there were many reviews, but most were positive and there were very few other similar negative reviews, I would want to still go to the restaurant I picked. I would probably rely on the volume of reviews more than the source, but if there were not many reviews overall, I would weight the food critics reviews as more trustworthy than some random google reviewers. If I decided to start looking for alternatives, I would message friend A straight away saying sure, we can look for a new place, and ask them if they had any ideas? Then I would find and book somewhere new. I'd message friend A later, probably the next day, explaining that I had to pay a deposit for the first restaurant, and ask if they would agree to pay a portion of the lost deposit. In that message I would also tell them that I was feeling frustrated that they didn't help me find a restaurant in the first place, and I was upset that they assumed I would take on the mental load of organising the dinner for our shared friend. My choice to keep the booking or change restaurant would be based on the other reviews on google etc that I had read today. I would feel inclined to keep the booking, almost out of spite that friend A didn't help to begin with, but also because I want to trust my research of good restaurants and I believe I'm pretty good at discerning these things."
R_4qluSYSvHUIOf2k,"A. I would be very angry that the friend who did not help is also deciding 3 hours before that we should not go to the restaurant. B. I would tell them that since it's already been booked we will be going, and that they can choose to join you or not. C. I trust my gut and my instinct as well as the reviews from the food critics. D. See if friend A wants to come or not because we would still be going to the restaurant."
R_9onXY2s2JyVJbhv,"they seem like a jerk for initially ghosting me so i would ignore it, especially if ive done my owj research"
R_4HeSPUC68yjFO8N,"When I read the message from friend A, I felt a mix of frustration and annoyance. First of all, friend A ignored my request for help a month ago, leaving me to handle the restaurant - booking alone. And now, just three hours before dinner, they come up with this concern. I'd immediately reply to friend A, saying, ""It's a bit late to bring this up now. I trusted your help before, but you left me hanging. And the food critics have given this place great reviews."" To judge which information is trustworthy, I know that food critics usually base their reviews on in - depth tastings and research, while the random Google reviews might be one - sided or even false. So, I'd quickly check if there are any official health reports about the restaurant. I also considered calling the restaurant directly to ask about the food - poisoning claim. After making these checks and still finding no solid evidence of the food - poisoning incident, I'd decide to keep the reservation. The reason is that the positive reviews from food critics carry more weight, and it's too late to find another suitable restaurant with most nearby places fully booked."
R_4od1XXDsfRPjEXm,"I would think that the behavior of friend A is not very good. When I made a reservation at a restaurant and paid the non-refundable reservation deposit, friend A didn't reply to me. Instead, three hours before the dinner, he told me that the restaurant I chose had a bad rating because some diners had food poisoning. This made me think that he was deliberately picking a fight with me. I would say to friend A, ""Then why didn't you tell me earlier? I had already paid the non-refundable deposit to this restaurant a month ago, and why did you only point out the problems with this restaurant on B's birthday? Since you didn't spend your money, weren't you concerned about this matter for the entire month?"" I would temporarily believe the food poisoning phenomenon that friend A mentioned and suspect that the food critics had fabricated the evaluation of this restaurant. Then I would go and check the Google reviews of this restaurant by myself. If the food poisoning was true, I would change my plan and cook a dinner for friend B to celebrate his birthday. If it was fake, I would keep the reservation and from now on, I won't have any contact with friend A."
R_46sDFz0luDI3hex,"A. My immediate reaction is annoyance. Friend A should have either 1. read some reviews earlier or 2. responded to my messages and helped me decide on a restaurant to go to. B. I would (as nicely as I could) tell Friend A that they should have read some reviews earlier and actually helped me when deciding on a restaurant. C. It's hard to tell which information is more trustworthy, because on the one hand I don't want to get food poisoning (and the customers may have just been angry and lied in their review), but also food critics critique food as their job, so I would hope that they know what they're talking about. D. I would consult more reviews from other sources (not just Google Reviews) to gain a better understanding of the bigger picture and to see what others are saying. My final choice would be to keep the booking, due to the fact that it would be difficult to find another restaurant at such short notice and it's for a friend's birthday so I wouldn't want to change plans at the last minute and stress them out on their birthday."
R_4s649qip03SoHtv,"Hmm… when I saw the message from Friend A, my first reaction was a mix of frustration and helplessness. I had asked them for help a month ago, but they never replied. Now, just three hours before the dinner, they suddenly show up with a screenshot of some negative Google reviews and say, “Maybe we shouldn’t go...” It feels like they didn’t really care about this gathering or take any responsibility. I might reply to them first, saying something like: “It’s a bit late to bring this up now. I asked for your help earlier and didn’t get any response. I actually researched this restaurant—it has really great reviews from food critics.” I would try to stay calm though, because I don’t want this to affect the mood of the evening. After all, it’s for Friend B’s birthday. As for the screenshot, I wouldn’t fully trust one or two bad reviews. There are always people online who have bad experiences, but I prefer to look at the overall rating, the number of reviews, and expert opinions. I remember this restaurant being recommended by several food blogs and review platforms, and many people praised the service and food quality. To be extra sure, I’d quickly check a few more review sites—like TripAdvisor and Yelp—to see if there are any consistent complaints about food poisoning. If not, and things look generally positive, I’d decide to stick with the reservation. My final decision is to keep the original plan. Here’s why: It’s too close to dinner time, and most nearby restaurants are fully booked. This is Friend B’s birthday, and I don’t want to ruin it with last-minute changes. The restaurant has strong ratings and positive reviews from critics—one bad review isn’t enough to change my mind. I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit. I’ll arrive early to make sure everything is in order. If there’s anything unusual, I’ll handle it then. What matters most is that Friend B has a great birthday celebration."
R_4n9nWCM2ZXttznb,"I would feel immediately irritated from the message, and honestly from the moment that they ghosted me. Because if we were supposed to plan this birthday together and they weren't helping (in this scenario, completely ghosted me) I would be really pissed since they are putting in zero effort. After I read the message, I would be severely irked but I would still reply cause at least they're putting in effort now... I would read the reviews that she sent and also, if I selected this restaurant it would have been because the reviews are positive and ive seen good stuff so I would tell her the other positive reviews. I would wait to see if she replies to these messages and see what she has to say. But I think I would still keep the booking, because non refundable, and if we all went and the vibe of the restaurant and the food isn't that good then I would suggest that we go to a bar or somewhere else."
R_9PBO2RW2Uhn7yYb,"Maybe I will say, “Thanks for letting me know — I’ll double-check. But most critic reviews have been really good, and I already secured the booking.” I’ll search the restaurant on official review platforms — Yelp, TripAdvisor, maybe even check local news — to see if there are any recent hygiene issues. I’ll also check their social media for any announcements. If I don’t see any consistent reports or official warnings, I’ll trust the critics and stick with the plan. Final choice: Keep the booking."
R_41NjFgMFB7MhGSU,"My first reaction would be frustrated and think why does Friend A bring this up now 3 hours right before the dinner after ghosting me during the planning. I would also feel a bit nervous because the deposit is non-refundable and finding another restaurant last minute is stressful. But, I would just have reply something like ""Hey, I wish you could mentioned this earlier since this deposit is non-refundable. Do you have specific concerns or just nervous about the google review?"" I would check the other social media other than just google review if there are lots of bad reviews around one date or not then it might be isolated incident. I'll go through recent social media tags and see if diners posted about the issue. Last, I'll check if Friend B has any dietary restrictions that could cause the risk. I would keep the booking as Friend A say all this too late and it is a waste of time and money. If Friend A is uncomfortable, I would suggest to join later for drinks or dessert instead."
R_4rCqFmyvttIJsWm,"A. My immediate reaction is panic and likely some type of regret, but also likely disdain for my friend in bringing this up so late for the inconvenience. B. I'd probably go into denial and try to find other reviews, then let them know the deposit is non-refundable, maybe see if they'd be guilted into paying some portion of it for the late response. I'd probably react with shock generally then immediately scramble for a plan b. C. If there is a frequency of reviews then it is almost guaranteed to be true unless highly coordinated. I'd check news sources for this happening as there's a chance it could show up, and also maybe check something like a local subreddit for it. D. I'd honestly cycle through available free choices nearby, like a beach walk, clubbing, home hangout, or just going to a park. In some circumstances, I might immediately deny my friend and maybe sweeten the deal by paying for their food, even eating it and taking them to a different place later just so I can try the restaurant."
R_4Ovi2m6ohfWjyD3,"Are you serious right now bruh? 3 hours before the dinner you decide to respond to my messages. You left me on delivered this whole time while I was planning for the dinner and only decide to pop up now. I've done some research and the place I found has reviews from food critics which say the restaurant is fine. Furthermore, the information that says we could get food poisoning could have really been useful before I paid the deposit for the dinner. We are are keeping the booking."
R_9rvi3VigpT7nmet,Would be annoyed that he has having opinions but not contributing when booking the restaurant. will just ignore him because he was not the one who paid the non refundable deposit. i will trust the positive reviews that i saw myself to make sure friend B is satisfied on his birthday. ultimately i will just keep the booking to not lose money on the deposit and because i believe the restaurant is good.
R_4pDzw3tv0JSJIeL,"seriously? Friend A is only telling me this three hours before dinner? I’m a bit annoyed because they didn’t help at all with the booking and now they’re suddenly concerned. My gut reaction is that this feels like overreacting — the restaurant has good reviews from professional food critics, which I trust more than a few random Google Reviews. People complain online for all sorts of reasons, and sometimes those reviews aren’t even reliable. I’d probably reply to Friend A with something like, “I get your concern, but it’s really last minute, and this place has been highly rated by critics. Are you sure those reviews aren’t just isolated incidents?” To be sure, I’d quickly double-check the restaurant’s latest reviews, maybe scan their social media or any recent news about food safety. If there’s no widespread report of food poisoning, I’ll keep the booking. Final choice: I’ll keep the booking because the critic reviews and lack of recent serious complaints seem more trustworthy, and changing plans now would be stressful and possibly ruin Friend B’s birthday."
R_9qVrcNn6GPJONYR,"In the first place itself I asked for help so that we could decide on a restaurant that suits us all but Friend A did not respond to my texts which is pretty unethical and on top that they are texting me last minute to change the venue, if it were such a problem they should have spoken up sooner when they were clearly and respectfully given the chance. But now I have paid a non-refundable deposit so I would definitely not be keen on changing the venue."
R_4nCAtz7tZUEK7HU,"My immediate reaction would be one of annoyance or irritation, as if friend A helped me one month ago like he was supposed to, we would've had this issue arise earlier where it wouldn't be a big deal. Although I appreciate the gesture to help, it comes too late and also undermines the work I've done to organise this, which friend A was also supposed to help with as well. I would first check how frequently this food poisoning scenario occurred, and if it was just a one off or two time thing I would disregard it and favour the word of the food critics, as I perceive this to be more reliable. To friend A, I wouldn't complain or vocalise my thoughts directly to them, unless this was a problem which has repeatedly occurred or something I've had an issue with for a long time. I may complain about it to one of my closer friends later."
R_9rqxaybI5jjJniN,"Firstly, the evaluation of this restaurant has always been high. Is it true that there have been cases of poisoning among diners on Google, and is it a common occurrence? If so, consider changing the restaurant. If not, from the perspective that the deposit cannot be refunded and the surrounding restaurants are already fully booked, there is no need to change the restaurant. In addition, after booking the restaurant, friend A did not immediately communicate about the situation of their own restaurant. They only expressed their opinions now, which may not be because they have any objections to the restaurant itself, but only because they have their own ideas for this birthday party. Considering multiple factors such as the non refundable deposit, the infrequent occurrence of poisoning incidents among diners, and the lack of suitable restaurants for modification in the surrounding area, it was ultimately decided not to change the restaurant."
R_9dEoPRV5JbfOXpD,"When Friend A suddenly messaged about food poisoning claims at the restaurant, I felt a surge of frustration and suspicion. After being unresponsive for weeks, why raise concerns just three hours before dinner? The timing seemed calculated to create panic rather than solve problems. My immediate reply would be: *""Is this a recent review? The restaurant has excellent critic ratings, and we stand to lose our deposit. Honestly, why wait until the last possible moment to mention this?""* To properly assess the situation, I'd: 1. Thoroughly examine the Google review - checking dates, credibility of the reviewer, and whether others reported similar issues 2. Cross-reference with other review platforms and food blogs 3. Call the restaurant directly to ask about recent health inspections 4. Quickly research backup options, though chances of finding something good last-minute would be slim **Final Decision:** If the negative review appears to be an isolated incident amid overwhelmingly positive feedback, I'd keep the reservation - trusting professional critics' opinions over one questionable online review. The lost deposit would also factor into this decision. However, if I found multiple credible reports of recent health issues, I'd immediately contact Friend B to discuss alternatives, even if it meant paying another deposit elsewhere. Ultimately, I wouldn't let Friend A's eleventh-hour intervention derail plans without concrete evidence, but would prioritize everyone's safety if legitimate concerns emerged."
R_48H5gk6KZzuoe1V,"Oh no! I can't believe this is happening just three hours before dinner. My first gut reaction is fustration- I asked Friend A to help plan this weeks ago, and now they suddenly come up with this warning at the last minute. I'm also worried about the risk: food poisoning is serious, but I also remember this restaurant has excellent reviews from professional food critics. I would probably reply to Friend A riight away:""Thanks for flagging this- let me check quickyly, we can't afford to cancel for no reason."" Then I would try to figure out whether these Google reviews are trustworthy. Are they recent? Do they look genuine or exaggerated? I might also check other review sites like Yelp or TripAdvisor for consistency. Given that we’re so close to the dinner time, I’d probably also call the restaurant directly to ask if they’ve had any health inspection issues recently. After weighing everything, unless there are many recent complaints, I’d keep the booking. The deposit is non-refundable, most restaurants nearby are likely fully booked, and the food critics’ reviews give me confidence. So my final decision would be: keep the reservation but stay cautious, and inform Friend B and the group so they can choose to go or not."
R_9uW0SHafhi4vixt,"When I read Friend A’s message, I felt very annoyed. Why did they wait so long to say something? They didn’t help before, and now they’re making a problem three hours before the dinner. I also felt worried—what if the food poisoning is real? I would text Friend A and say, “Thanks for the info. Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” I’d also ask where they found the reviews and when the bad reviews were posted. To decide if it’s true, I would look at the date of the bad reviews. If they are old, maybe the problem is fixed now. I would also check if many people said the same thing, or just one or two. I might call the restaurant and ask if they had any food safety problems. If they sound honest and confident, I will feel better. In the end, I would keep the booking. The deposit is non-refundable, and the critic reviews are still good. I’ll just be extra careful with what I order."
R_9ncGoQdVn4dUlmm,"Why would you ask this now after I have already booked the restaurant. Like imagine ghosting me for weeks and then saying or well implying that they don't want to eat here cause of what food safety. I can't even make a refund and I'm stressed as it is. Like you didn't even pay or split a deposit for the booking and that irritates me the most. I just assumed that we were busy or making a better plan but all I got was silence. Like I did everything out of my own heart and now you are trying to make me feel guilty. This is so last-minute and it didn't have to be if you could've just contributed even a little. Despite that, the warning about food poisoning does concern me. It might just be those unlucky people, I'll check for any health inspection history as well as how recent those google revies are. I might as well call the restaurant just to be safe and politely ask if there were recent complaints. But honestly the reviews I found from those legit critics wash out the negativity. I rather trust them then some anonymous user. At the end of the day, I want to celebrate Friend B's so I'd honestly keep the booking to save the money I spent."
R_9IYxSYxjx5h2jMM,"I would be upset and confused about the situation, and I would tell Friend A that it should be fine because I had heard a lot of good reviews, and this was Friend B's birthday. I would go with the overall review and I would double check my friends are able to go someone further if they are scared about getting poisoned."
R_9jGQkrcYf5X8zyV,"Hey Friend A, how have you been? I read your message regarding the restaurant booking for tonight. That is crazy that some people have got food poisoning. I conducted my research and found that it had received great reviews from food critics. I asked for your opinion on where you should go, but you didn't say anything. I have already paid a non-refundable deposit for the reservation. What should we do? We stick to the plan and go because most other places are fully booked."
R_4RTYxFTZ4Y0JCgj,"A= my immediate emotional reaction was annoyance. I think they only said that because they didn't like the choice. B= ""Surely if there was actual food poisoning there would be some evidence of it"" C= I'd decide the information was trustworthy based on how recent the ""incident"" was and if all the reviews were posted at the same time. D= I would check to see if the review was vague or not. I would keep the booking because the timing is too convenient and we have already paid a non-refundable deposit."
R_9j0z8JXT8CPjNa9,"Upon reading the abrupt message, I am disappointed and frustrated that Friend A decided to share their concerns with me so late. I would tell Friend A that the restaurant I have reserved is non-refundable and that they should have mentioned their concerns to me sooner. I would double-check on Google and online through the possible reviews Friend A may have seen, and whether the opposing information supports their claims about food poisoning. If I deem it necessary, I would cancel the booking and find a different restaurant to celebrate the birthday."
R_9tx5ryf4EHIGS7l,
R_93ghrbs9UkMfX8J,"Uhhh then what else and wehere else are we going to eat, id say to my friend what are we gonna do now if this is the only place where we can food. When many reviews are on the website and theres is variation and there are different times people have reviewed making it seem more legit. Id look at other restaraunts and see their reviews and yeah."
R_4uDGi9a0ycjkTF3,"A. I would be quite exasperated as they could have contacted me about their concerns before I invested a non-refundable deposit into the restaurant. And there is almost no time left to book a restaurant anyways. B. I'd tell him or her that it would be too late to change the decision. I would advise them to not order or eat any raw food in case they were especially concerned about food poisoning. C. In my opinion the Google Reviews can be easily fabricated, however it is also true that if a known food critic is eating at a restaurant, then the food they receive may often be prepared with greater care. Nevertheless I would say that the Google Reviews is by far the less reliable source here. D. I would also call up the restaurant and enquire about the reviews, or enquire about the dishes that may cause gastrointestinal incontinence. I would still keep the booking. I already paid a non-refundable booking, all the other venues are nearly full and Friend A had a lot of time to contact me about restaurant concerns. I also don't fully trust the authenticity of the concerns."
R_9ZAOmb32UlCKiNr,"My first reaction was confusion,and I felt a little upset.I might say,where have u been these past few days ""I couldn’t reach you.and now you’re telling me my choice is problem?then what exactly is your decision? I’ll do more research across platforms.if what him say turns out to be true,I’ll adjust my plan.but if not,I’m standing by it .because I don’t think I’m the one at fault.Him stayed silent for days ,so the decision I made during that time time should be respected."
R_4RWEXebBoYvE0NO,"I would be quite confused initially but wouldn't really care about the concerns as the food critics gave great reviews initially. Maybe be a bit anoyed that they ignored me but wouldn't be that concerned. “Hey, I get the concern, but I wish you brought this up earlier when I asked for help. I already paid a non-refundable deposit and the restaurant has great critic reviews too.” I might glance at the reviews myself just to be sure, but unless the top ten all say “food poisoning,” I’m not worried. Plus, I already paid the deposit and it’s non-refundable, so changing plans now feels like a waste. Everywhere else is probably booked anyway. I would go in with the plan and message them that it should be fine but I would most likely finalise the plan when we meet up together. If over text they don't mind eating then that would be fine, but if they show some resistance then we would talk it further in person."
R_9rpBq7JtZNZ0MRl,"I would feel a bit confused and annoyed that Friend A had not helped me to find the restaurant and had only communicated with me to criticise my choice of restaurant. I would ask him where he got this review from and how long it was ago. I would also ask him why he didn’t tell me about this earlier and ask if he personally does not want to go to this restaurant. I would look at the recency of the review to see if it was trustworthy and also see if there are any other reviews saying the same thing. If there are more reviews which are recent that say this place has given them food poisoning, I would look for another restaurant but if not I would keep the reservation."
R_9QdZGbw9eGv7onD,"I would be extremely pissed off as I tried to communicate with them, but if they're not responding to the texts is generally annoying. It is their fault for not checking the messages so I would say we should be fine and still go to the restaurant as it is highly rated by food critics. I would have a look at the reviews to check how many people actually got food poisoning, cause even though they have a high rating by food critics they can get payed to write the reviews. Whereas the reviews online can be made out of hate but most of them are generally real. Also would double check if they have any awards or if they are always booked out and busy as it can reveal if the restaurant is good or bad. My final choice would probably be to just go to the resutratn because I tried to communicate but if they didn't respond they can not complain."
R_9ByyIa2303GfW0A,"My initial reaction would be annoyed, frustrated and confused as to why Friend A hadn't responded until the day of the dinner. I would then tell him that I had already booked everything and paid for everything, and the critic reviews I had seen were different to the Google Reviews. I would provide screenshots and evidence for the critic reviews, but also take into account the Google reviews to make sure those comments weren't reliable. I would then let Friend A know how disrespectful their actions are, and how difficult and stressful the situation they made was for me. I would finally also let them know that I would tell Friend B of the things Friend A did."
R_90r7lA63og2GuKL,"Ugh… seriously? I just saw Friend A’s message, and my first reaction is frustration. Where was this energy when I asked for help a month ago? I’ve already paid the deposit, and now, three hours before dinner, they’re raising concerns based on a few random Google reviews? I’d reply: “Hey, I get your concern, but it’s really last-minute. The place has glowing reviews from food critics, and we booked it because nothing else was available. Why bring this up now?” I’d definitely re-check the reviews — not just the negative ones, but the overall trend. Are the bad reviews recent or isolated? Are they even about the same location? I’d also quickly search for any official health inspection notices about the restaurant. If there’s no formal warning or consistent red flags, I’d trust the critics and the majority of diners who had positive experiences. Friend A’s timing seems off, and I can’t ignore that they didn’t contribute when it mattered. In the end, I’d stick with the booking. Changing now would cause chaos, we’d likely lose the money, and it’s too late to rebook somewhere good. I’d tell everyone to show up — and maybe just avoid the oysters."
R_9ly8qis9dlrc9ar,"My initial reaction was a mix of disappointment and frustration. You’d think that at our ages we’re capable of making a simple reservation for a friend, which makes me think of 4 main possibilities, friend A either doesn’t like friend B due to some reason, possibly experiencing something in their home life or other aspect, could possibly be trying to avoid responsibility, knowing that I’ll make the booking anyways, or possibly struggles to help and communicate as a team? Their observation about the food poisoning was a good catch, but at this point in time there’s nothing to be done, and focussing on a useless solution doesn’t help. Instead of maybe we shouldn’t go… they could’ve suggested something like “let’s not try the fish” or smth more helpful. At this point I would stick with the original booking, but look further into the food poisoning case, hopefully trying to avoid the possibility of us having the same outcome. I’d also express to friend A and ask them if something was going on. I’d also express how I felt abandoned and disappointed that all the responsibility was thrown onto me, and point out that the last minute comment was possibly phrased poorly."
R_4bQXQnGPkraYQ3D,"My immediate reaction is that Friend A doesn't care enough about Friend B to put any effort into celebrating their birthday and wishes to take credit for planning their birthday celebration without putting any work in. I would tell Friend A that it would be too late to switch what restaurant we go to now and tell them that the reviews I saw online were really positive. Given that Friend A has shown some history in being unreliable and disorganised, I would choose to believe my own research that I've done on the restaurant to eat at since it seems that Friend A is wanting to potentially sabotage the birthday dinner or take credit for organising the celebration at the expense of me and my planning. I would double check that the reviews I saw were positive and send some screenshots of them to Friend A to further prove that we should go to the restaurant I chose. My final choice is that I would keep the booking since it's a nice restaurant with good reviews, and I'm skeptical that Friend A is trying to do something shady on Friend B's birthday."
R_41FkWLVk7rYU62L,"they should've told me they had an issue when i first asked them. no way im changing it this late. i'll kindly tell them we should still give it a go because its been given lots of other good reviews. it's not their choice to move it seeing as they didn't help at all with booking. also, i'll suggest that if we do decided to move it, she'll have to suggest a new restaurant and split the deposit with me seeing as I did all the work. I mean I guess i understand her concern, but why couldnt she have said something earlier. everything is always so last minute with her. oh well i'll message and suggest we leave it and see what she says, maybe it was only a few reviews, she does tend to get worried about that sort of stuff. it'll be fine."
R_9IOGliiBUtJWMc9,"I would be a little angry at first because nobody got any ideas but only me do the reservation but when we were about to have the meal ""Friend A"" appeared and that was quite annoying.But it was understandable because he just said his thoughts though that was too late. I would say why couldn't told me earlier because I had paid the money already. And to be honest I wouldn't pay much attention to whether the info is true or fake.It's a waste of time and what was more important was to satisfy everyone.I think i would not just insist what I chose but instead, have a discussion with them to choose a more satisfying plan , even if it meant I have to afford finance loss.But I probably unwilling to have a next meal with them in the future."
R_9CNkRH6KOycR6TU,"Firstly, I would be very annoyed at Friend A for the lack of communication on their end for the entire planning period. I think that we should just stick to the original booking, because its really close to Friend B's birthday and its also non-refundable. I'm assuming that the deposit is pretty pricey too. If Friend A actually responded to our text earlier about restaurant choices prior to putting in the deposit and warned about the food poisoning, then that would've given the opportunity to change restaurants earlier if they were concerned about food poisoning at the chosen restaurant. Also, unless Friend A has reviews or proof about the food poisoning, then I think, again, we should just stick to the original booking. I'm also assuming that we did more than enough research about restaurants in the area, that if there were any food poisoning cases, then it would come up. Thus, we should just keep the original booking."
R_9PYWjHPxUOfIAnw,"I would feel that friend A backstab me, they don't help me to find and book a restaurant, but they are dissatisfied with the restaurant I chose. Friend A would even send the screenshots to friend B, and friend B would also be dissatisfied with me. I will not respond friend A's text, and keep the booking. Because whatever I reply, they can stop responding again. I do not want to make friend B unhappy, so it is necessary to keep this restaurant. I will check the review of this restaurant again to make sure it is safe. If positive reviews are the majority, I will believe this restaurant is good. Finally, I will send screenshots of great reviews from food critics to friend B, and keep a distance from friendA in the future."
R_9qm6ZczrGsxoZf7,"While I would be partially concerned by the content of the google reviews that friend A had sent, I would be more perturbed by the fact that friend A hadn't contributed to helping find a restaurant and only had criticisms about the restaurant I had to find by myself. Additionally, considering I had paid out of pocket a non-refundable deposit, and also that at them point of friend A messaging the criticisms it would be too late to rebook another venue, I would be further agitated. While I do see the merit in checking the restaurants public reviews as the restaurant may have gone above and beyond to please critics and impact their reviews, the reasons cited above would prevent me altering my choice of restaurant. In this scenario I would keep the booking due to the timing, the lack of input from Friend A and the out of pocket expense already incurred."
R_9CxHjiLEAvYA1Z7,"A. Why friend A interupt my decision when he did not involve in booking the restaurant. I have already chosen carfully and paid the non-refundable deposit and now you telling me we should not go due to your finding of the bad reviews while i fould their good review. B. ""Hey, maybe we should find more review on this to discover whether the restaurant is really bad, there is always bad review on google so we should double checked it. Since I have already paid the deposit, if we are not going we need to split this bill. Decide quickly so we have enough time to provide alternative options."" C. I will check multiple websites on the restaurant review or ask friend who have been there or if it is near I will go to the place and check if it is famous and busy. D. Check that bad review is recently posted, if not they might have improve on food safety. It can also be purposely misleading review from other restaurant. I will keep the booking until it is comfirmed that the restaurant is bad or someone give me a better option which i know it is pleasant and split the non-refundable deposit with me."
R_4NDmSPqopKb7O1c,"Ugh… seriously? Three hours before the dinner and now they care? I’m honestly so frustrated. Where was this energy a month ago when I asked for help? I tried to involve them and they ghosted me — I was the one who found the restaurant and paid the deposit. And now they send me a few bad reviews and want to cancel? Okay, breathe. Let’s not overreact. First of all, I know this place has amazing reviews from actual food critics — like in magazines and blogs. It’s popular for a reason. Sure, someone on Google said they got food poisoning, but those reviews can be unreliable. People exaggerate all the time online. One or two bad reviews among hundreds of positives? Not enough to panic. I’d text Friend A back and say, “Thanks for the heads-up, but I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit and the place has great critic reviews. I think we’re good to go.” Just to be safe, I’d check the restaurant’s Instagram or any recent posts to see if they’ve said anything about health concerns — maybe even call them quickly to confirm everything’s running smoothly. Final decision? Keep the booking. We’re too close to the event to change now, and there’s no solid reason to believe this place is unsafe. Plus, Friend B deserves a nice dinner, not last-minute chaos."
R_9AN9hSpXOdSyURH,"Ok they stopped responding so I'll just book it. Well mate I already booked it so we kind of have to. Plus all other places are booked. Whatever happens happens, if we get food poisoning tough luck. C. I wouldn't really care about the info D. Not really A. Well nice but I already booked it B. Already paid we gotta go"
R_4iUoQNwPj2jAKyv,I would be upset that friend A did not help with finding and booking a reservation somewhere. I would ask why friend A did not help with finding a restaurant and would tell them that we are keeping the booking because I had to pay for it and it is non-refundable. I would also show them the good food reviews and just tell them that it is too late to change and that the food poisoning was most likely a one time thing.
R_9MSYEATuG2THmYs,"A. This guy didn't do any work and now he's complaining? Ask the legitimacy of the google reviews since the health of the friends come first. C. I would look at what type of resturaunts, what is being complained about etc. D. Maybe scout the resturaunt myself before making a choice. If possible I would find another venue however if not stick to this one."
R_4obtThjO6vzifmO,"a.Why on earth should this responsibility be left up to me? I would feel aggressive and irritable that I have to be the one to set everything up because I care about my friend and Friend A doesn't. To be honest, i'll be excited to report this back to friend B that friend A didn't help out with anything. Not that friendship is a competition but because it's not cool that I had to do everything and friend A left it for me to plan. B. Assuming the ""maybe we shouldn't go"" was sent through by text I would immediately reply with, 'too late, I've booked and paid for the reservation. Lets take our chances. Then i'll send the details of the event and also her half of the cost. c. I would take everything with a grain of salt. If theres some good reviews then that's fine but I don't mind going to a badly rated resturaunt. d. send me ur half..."
R_9fwwUsGWe4ahb3J,"Immediately I felt annoyed and upset by the thought of losing my deposit and seeing my friend. I think I would mention the fact that I paid a non-refundable deposit and also mention the time and that we would have limited options to eat dinner elsewhere. Food critics typically are trustworthy due to their image and followers which respect their decisions. Google reviews are easily fabricated and are often non-truthful or are plagued by overly critical middle-aged individuals. I would investigate the google reviews to see when they were posted as well as the date of the last food critic review to check the recency of the 'food poisoning' claims. Ultimately due to the late notice, lack of input from Friend A and the abundance of good reviews from critics, I would keep and attend the pre-decided reservation."
R_91xFvPuhzoLYe09,"since i have paid a non-refundable deposit, i may not get my money back cancelling three hours before the reservation. and we might not be able to find anywhere else to eat and this ruins friend B's birthday plans. friend A put no effort or time into choosing the restaurant and now they are going against your choice so close to the time of the reservation and that is annoying and rude and dismissive of your effort, so i think friend A doesn't really deserve a say now, even though they are trying to protect you from food poisoning, but just becasue some people get food poisoning there doesnt mean you will, it is very unlikely. and food critics love to food so it seems to be a good restaurant. therefore, i would keep the booking"
R_9Y5jqFKG2qMXrMH,"Before replying, I need to cool my tone so I don’t come off too harsh. But I’d probably text back something like: “Hey, I get the concern but this is super last minute. I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit and most places are booked out tonight. Are you sure these reviews aren’t just outliers? The place has good critic reviews.” Next, I need to think practically. How do I know which reviews to trust? Food poisoning reviews can happen at any restaurant, even top ones. Sometimes people post exaggerated stuff when they’re mad. I should check if these complaints are recent and clustered together (which could mean a real problem), or if they’re random and months apart. If most reviews are still positive overall, that’s a sign the place is generally fine. I’ll quickly jump back onto Google and Yelp, maybe even look up their Instagram to see if any diners are posting stories today—do they seem happy? Also, I’ll search for any recent health inspection reports online. Usually if there’s a serious issue, it would show up there. Assuming I don’t find anything urgent or consistent, I’m leaning towards keeping the booking. We’re too close to the event to scramble for a new spot without stressing everyone, especially Friend B—it’s their birthday and the last thing I want is to ruin the night with chaos."
R_42DGL2I53q6AtnU,"I would feel frustrated at friend A as they had neglected to help me find the restaurant, leading me to not only do all the work in finding a restaurant, but also in paying the deposit. I would immediately tell friend A that I had paid a non-refundable deposit, and highlight how many established food critics had left high reviews. Following this, I would check the google reviews of the restaurant again (although might I add, I most likely probably already checked the reviews before booking, since I had seen reviews from food critics). If the reviews had a high volume of recent food poisoning reviews, then I would feel obliged to cancel, but would ask friend A to pay me half of the deposit, as we were meant to book this restaurant together anyways. If there was one or two food poisoning reviews, or if many of these alleged food poisoning reviews were not recent, I would make the decision to continue as A) food critics are often much more trustworthy than google reviews, unless there are multiple google reviews saying the same thing; B) most nearby venues are full and finding a new reservation would be a pain; C) I paid a non-refundable deposit that I would very much not like to lose and D) friend A ghosted me, and only texts me back now? If they had concerns maybe they should've played a more active role in finding a restaurant rather than offloading on me at the last minute."
R_9zAUnGRFYT3T1fY,
R_448C7cW8wSXpC6o,"Bro are u serious they've only just gotten back to me why they doing this so bloody late actually incompetent who doesn't know how to answer their phone one time hi friend A, it's too late to book a new venue, most are full, i reckon we risk it for the biscuit n pray we don't get food poisoning, maybe we just wont order anything high risk i would go through the reviews which show which meals could've possibly led to the food poisoning and avoid them i would keep the booking because it's way too late to find a new venue and if food critics say it's good i will trust that"
R_9tnHNQwVXmXn7Vj,"I feel unbelievable that my friend A didn't tell me that some diners got food poisoning early when I was finding that restaurant hardly. During the time I was finding the restaurant, you (friend A) didn't give me or suggest any ideas, but when I finally decided which restaurant we were going to help friend B celebrate his birthday, you just jumped out and told me that we should not go to this restaurant. I will tell friend A to shut up because it is too late for changing the restaurant. Also, I would tell friend A some Google reviews may not be true; we can't just read those reviews on Google and decide not to go to the restaurant. However, I will see a review of the restaurant again to check if it is just a random accident. I will try my best to find out the real information."
R_49s5JaRFUTihinG,"Bruh as if you text now what took you so long the restaurant literally have great reviews I don't know what your on about like that is highly infruitating. I say that because most reviews from food critics are positive, we should just go anyways plus all the other restaurants are full now anyways and we need to a place to celebrate. The information should be trustworthy as well as it comes from major food critics so lets just go yeah type."
R_4Etpbd36eElVfi7,"Initially, I would have felt betrayed, annoyed and disrespected by my friend. Since we had planned to book a place together, if feels like they are leeching off my time and efforts to do something, and then for them to chime in at the end to try and be 'helpful' in some way, irritates me. I would immediately let Friend A know that I have had my trust and respect breached, as they didn't seem to care for my time at all, and I would also tell them that they were arrogant and disrespectful to suggest to switch restaurants after I had spent time planning and booking things. I would trust my research, and stick to the restaurant I had already planned, as I had seen proper food critics, and I would Friend B know of what Friend A has done, and tell Friend A that if they were to do it again, I just wouldn't invite them next time."
R_9ceigsEeDCxgZmh,"My immediate reaction is annoyance. They should have helped or looked at reviews earlier if they wanted a say in where to go. To explain our situation, I'd lead with the fact that it's too late to change the restaurant anyway, and if we didn't go, we wouldn't have a nice restaurant to go to. Then I'd explain the great reviews from the food critics. While food critics are usually more reliable than online reviews, I acknowledge that there may be biases. Restaurants usually treat food critics much nicer than regular guests. Online reviews may be more authentic, but people can easily lie due to any personal vendettas or even just for no reason at all. Since bad reviews are usually guaranteed regardless of how nice an establishment is, I'd consider the ratio of good to bad online reviews. Perhaps I'd try to look for the restaurant's food safety certificate and see how recent it was attained or how renewed. I'd consider the price of the non-refundable deposit as well as the general reputation of the restaurant. Assuming there aren't any apparent red flags, I would keep the booking. The deposit is paid and changing plans so soon is a hassle. Assuming there aren't any significantly apparent red flags, I will keep the booking. e"
R_4Qrr4Sxrf7MWyC0,"My first gut reaction after reading Friend B’s message is confusion and a bit of doubt. Part of me feels slightly anxious—what if Friend B is right and we’re making a mistake sticking to the original plan? But another part of me feels defensive, like, ""Wait, we already booked this for a reason; I shouldn’t just change everything based on one message."" Emotionally, I feel torn between wanting to trust Friend B (since they might know something important) and not wanting to overreact. If I had to say something to Friend A right away, I’d probably say, “Hey, B messaged me about this—do you think we should look into it? Maybe we should double-check before making a decision.” I wouldn’t outright cancel anything yet; I’d want to discuss it with Friend A first since we planned this together. When it comes to deciding what’s trustworthy, I’d think about how reliable Friend B usually is. Do they normally share accurate info, or do they overreact? I’d also check if they provided any evidence or if it’s just their opinion. If it’s something important, I might look online or ask someone else who’s been there recently. Before choosing, I’d definitely do some quick research—maybe check reviews, schedules, or official updates—and talk to Friend A about it. I wouldn’t want to waste money or ruin the plan based on a rumor. My final choice: I’d keep the booking unless I find solid evidence that changing plans is necessary. Right now, Friend B’s message alone isn’t enough for me to switch. But I’d stay open to changing if I find reliable confirmation."
R_4FEe0xLd6itwVFL,"When I received a text message from my friend A, I felt a little angry and helpless at the same time. A month ago, I contacted him to ask him to share the planning tasks with me, but he didn't respond at all. In the end, I did everything myself and paid the non-refundable deposit out of my own pocket. Now, with only three hours left before dinner, he suddenly pops up and says, ‘Maybe we shouldn't go.’ This really makes me feel unfair. The most critical issue is that changing restaurants at this point is extremely difficult. We booked quite late, and the popular restaurants in this area are likely already fully booked. Changing locations at the last minute could ruin Friend B’s birthday, especially if we can’t find a new place to eat. B has been looking forward to tonight, and I don’t want him to feel like we didn’t prepare properly."
R_4K2wWM1201O7BbJ,"Reserve your reservation. ​​ Reason The credibility of information is weighed: The generally high praise from professional food critics weighs far more than a few unverified, anonymous Google negative reviews (especially those that have been ""carefully"" selected). Urgency and feasibility: With only three hours left until dinner, it is almost impossible to guarantee finding a place of good quality and with a seat when changing locations at the last minute. The greater possibility is to cancel the entire celebration or end up in a worse restaurant. Sunk cost consideration: That non-refundable deposit is no small amount. It feels so frustrating to lose this sum of money for nothing after friend A gave up. The credibility of Friend A: His previous disappearance and lack of help, coupled with this sudden last-minute panic, make it hard for people to take his ""warning"" too seriously. Risk mitigation measures: We will pay more attention at that time - order thoroughly cooked dishes, observe the atmosphere of the restaurant, and avoid the high-risk foods mentioned in the comments. If others seem suspicious, I will quietly remind everyone."
R_2hBdnry1AtOl99m,"Oh no — my heart just dropped when I saw Friend A’s message. We’re only three hours away from dinner, and now I’m being told that the restaurant might have caused food poisoning? Seriously? After all this planning and stress — and especially after A completely ghosted me when I asked for help — this feels like a slap in the face. My first reaction is frustration. I want to text A something like: “You ignored me for weeks and now suddenly you’re worried?” But I need to stay calm and think this through. I know I can’t just cancel last minute without checking the facts, especially since we’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit. I’ll start by looking at the Google reviews myself. Are there multiple recent reports of food poisoning or just one or two random comments? I’ll also check the dates — maybe the issue was months ago and already resolved. Then I’ll search the restaurant’s name in local news or social media to see if anything serious was reported. Given the restaurant’s strong reputation with food critics and how late it is to find alternatives, I’m leaning toward keeping the booking. But to be safe, I’ll call the restaurant directly and ask if they’re aware of any recent complaints. If they’re transparent and confident, I’ll feel better about sticking to the plan. Unless I find strong evidence that it’s unsafe, I’ll keep the booking. It’s too late and too risky to change now, and Friend B deserves a well-planned birthday dinner — not chaos because Friend A suddenly panicked."
R_9viZJcOtFe2UMZI,"my immediate gut reaction would be annoyance, because friend A could have brought this up with me earlier. if they brought it up earlier, I could have changed the restaurant or not paid the non-refundable deposit. I'd probably say to friend a 'thanks for letting me know, however this restaurant has great reviews from food critics and I've already paid the deposit. also, there will be no where else to go at this time'. honestly, google reviews seem to be more reliable than food critics, since they may be paid to advertise the business. I would probably check if there are any undisclosed advertisements in the food critic reviews, as well as check whether the negative google reviews have anything in common (food poisoning associated with a specific dish). ultimately, I would keep the booking, because there probably isn't another restaurant open, and I'm annoyed at friend a for only helping at the last second."
R_9qCqgxLFaxmotAR,"I would be annoyed that they ghosted me and felt that they could make judgemental comments about something we were supposed to do together. I would keep these thoughts to myself to try to maintain peace and reply with something along the line of ""I have reviewed comments from food critics and the restaurant is held in high regard. Ive already paid a deposit I cannot get back and it is now too late to change to somewhere else."" I would be concerned if there were numerous recent reviews talking about food poisoning but if the critic reviews were also recent then I would trust them more. If A was so concerned about it (possibly rightfully so, depends on the date of the reviews) then I would happily switch the restaurant if they organized it and refunded me the deposit. I would lean towards keeping the booking unless I'm refunded, and depending on if A apologized for disappearing I might rethink the friendship."
R_4IuXMRl31zVDX2Z,"Three hours before the dinner, and now Friend A wants to raise concerns? Where was this energy when I asked them for help a month ago? I can’t believe they ghosted me back then, and now they’re suddenly worried because of a few Google reviews. This feels so unfair I put in the effort, paid the deposit, and now they want to derail the whole plan. Okay, breathe. Let me look at the screenshots they sent. Yeah, a couple of people are complaining about food poisoning, but I also remember reading reviews from actual food critics who raved about this place. It’s not like every restaurant has perfect reviews even good places can have the occasional bad night. Still, I should double-check. I’ll quickly look up more recent reviews, maybe on a few different platforms like TripAdvisor or even Instagram to see if anyone’s posting about it tonight. Also, I’ll call the restaurant not to cancel, just to ask a few questions casually. Like what their food safety rating is or if they’ve had any recent complaints. If anything seemed sketchy, I’d feel it. As for Friend A, I’m tempted to just ignore the message, but I’ll keep it civil. Something like: “I’ve seen some great critic reviews and checked the food safety rating everything looks good. Given the short notice and non-refundable deposit, we’re still going. I hope you’ll come!” Bottom line: we’re going. Friend B deserves a proper celebration, and this was the best option we had. I’ve done my homework."
R_9f8TBp2vAQXd329,"When I first read Friend A's message, I would be annoyed as she didn't respond to my texts when I asked for her opinion and help which I have to do everything on my own. I would reply to her chats by telling how we already booked the restaurant and that I already search for food critics review before I booked this restaurant, that most restaurants nearby is already full if we cancelled on this one. I would also tell her that I already paid the deposit for this restaurant and that it is non-refundable. If the food critic review is in a form of video in social media, I would send her the link so that Friend A can see, but if it is in the form of text, I would just send her a screenshot of the proof that I researched about the restaurant before booking. I would believe food critics as I am sure that these critics must have tasted every food in every restaurants which I'm sure if they said its good then it must be very good. Eventually, I would keep the booking as most of the restaurants with good food must be very packed already especially for walk-ins."
R_9QLchgtc6B8476G,"A. initially i felt annoyed/frustrated as friend a did not bother to help to begin with and is only mentioning something three hours before the booking when they could have said something earlier B. why did you not respond to my initial texts about the booking / why did you not mention this issue earlier C. determine if food critics were paid to go to the restaurant/leave a review or if they voluntarily went and left good reviews, see the google reviewers history (other ratings they have made) D. check if any other resturant, with better ratings, is available, give friend b options and ask what they would prefer My final choice is keep booking - deposit is non-refundable, friend b would probably feel disappointed if we were not able to get another booking, can avoid dishes that have higher risks of food poisoning/order drinks"
R_93vFP1P8RlZwhtL,"First of all, I will be very unhappy and angry. And I will say to friend A: Why didn't you reply when I was communicating with you? Now that I'm running over here, you're saying that my choice is flawed. If you are not satisfied, you should have communicated with me a month ago instead of now. Secondly, I think although the screenshot of Google's comments has some persuasive power, since I'm not sure about the intentions of friend A, I will check for myself to see if these things actually happened. Personally, I think it might have happened before, but not recently. Finally, my final decision is that if I confirm that there has been a poisoning incident recently, I will go to the merchant to discuss the matter and refund the fee for the reserved position. If no such event has occurred recently, I would choose to keep the reservation. Even if they don't come, I will still go and eat by myself."
R_41Ba1as7ba32vsJ,"I would be pretty pissed off at him since if he wanted to have any input he probably should have said it early like a month earlier knowing my friend hes probably a bum so I know he didn't have anything urgent or anything to attend to. Unless he did though, for example his parents might have gotten into a car crash and died and so he couldn't respond, but still regardless of how traumatic this event was he should still have the decency to respond at least within a month, not just about this dinner but telling me about what happened to him as friends should do. So I'd probably tell him that if he wanted to change the booking he shouldve said something earlier and that me and friend B will be going to this place regardless of if A was coming or not. In regards to the reviews I'd probably think nothing of it as not only am I pissed of at A but you can find anyone saying anything on the internet, and so i would keep the booking."
R_9Z7mlqmSLzfiFhf,"I already paid the deposit, why is A telling me just now, why didn't A respond to my messages earlier when I needed them to? And A is just telling me now? That is not going to help the situation at all. So now if we actually don't go, either A and me split the deposit price and we go to a new place or we just go to the place I picked. But food poisoning is dangerous and the reviews food critics gave might have been biased. It's quite risky. I also should've checked the Google Reviews before I booked. That's my mistake. Maybe we should also consult B and see what they say. But I am still annoyed at why A stopped replying and is only saying all of this now. Where was A when I needed them? Final choice is to change plans because it is B's birthday and it is not worth it the risk."
R_41yLbDAOwRjV9ZD,"My immediate gut reaction would be shock at the news and annoyance/confusion at why the friend responded after so long. I would immediately research to try and see if these reviews are authentic or not and contact the restaurant directly to ask about this. I would also check online on social media. If it's true, I would demand a refund for the booking. What I would mention to the friend is the high rating from food critics and ask why they haven't responded for so long/if everything is alright with them. I would also check in with Friend B first to make sure they can come. My final choice would depend on whether the reviews seem trustworthy and what the restaurant says when I call them. This is because I don't want to have wasted my money as it's not refundable but want to take my friend's text into consideration just in case it is true."
R_9AMDoqFupvbMn0u,"(There's probably a typo? As we received the message from A instead of B, my response will be under the circumstance of where the message comes from A instead of B) I would be disappointed and displeased as I'm about to lose money when I first received A's message. I would then check the google review myself to see how recent the food poisoning occurred. If it happened within this week, I would suggest eating takeout at whoever's house, if not I would try to convince them to go. I would overall try to keep the situation light as its B's birthday and I do not want to cause any tension. So I will probably respond with a surprised emoji. Regarding A's lack of response a month prior I would no longer ask for their opinion and instead take full control of the situation. Overall, I will change plans for us, as I don't want my friend risk to get diarrhoea on their birthday. But because I don't want to waste money, I would check if I can change booking date and go by myself some other time."
R_9FM1heUaLdVQUsx,"My immediate reaction is that friend A shouldnt have an opinion. if I planned it all myself and they dont like the restaurant they shoudlve said something earlier. however, if they hold that opinion strongly id just reply saying i already paid the deposit and if they really want something done then they can pay the deposit and find a new place. i would trust their information if its in a screenshot like theres no reason i shouldnt but then i would go check myself. i would look the restaurant up to see if there are bad reviews and then be like oh i actually found these ones theyre mostly good if they are. i would decide to keep the booking unless the friend wanted to pay the deposit i already paid and wanted to find somewhere else. id probably explain too that most of the review are good and itll be okay anyway."
R_9IYl1rZSCRvKRkD,"I would be frustrated at friend a, as they made no help to make plans and have now decided to suggest something different, after a nonrefundable deposit. I would say to friend a that I had only heard good stuff and seen really good reviews, that a nonrefundable deposit was paid and that they should have said something earlier. I would go and check reviews myself. depending on reviews I would most likely keep the booking as it is meant to be good and is non-refundable."
R_4jBC0qyqsZWEaQL,"I would be very angry, firstly, I picked the venue and paid for it. Further, not replying to someone's message is rude in my opinion, and I am booking the restaurant for them. I would probably say to my friend A, Please pick a restaurant yourself. I would read the reviews of the restaurant again. If there is only one review, then it should be a chance event; if there are more than three of this kind of review, then I think I would consider it. Also, if there is other software, I would check the reviews. Before making a final decision, I would ask my friend B's opinion, as it's his birthday, if he wants to be at this restaurant, he doesn't have to make a change, if he wants a different one, let him choose. After the discussion with B, I will decide whether to keep the booking or change the plan, and if I do change the plan, I will most likely leave them to their own choices and booking."
R_4fEgJqtJj1UGFQQ,"A. confused B. ask him why he took so long to reply C. decide on the overall rating of reviews D. ask a friend or family who has been to the restaurant about their experience. Keep the booking, as I was forced to decide alone."
R_4hA67MOCRzYcpR4,"Upon reading Friend A's message, my immediate gut - reaction is one of annoyance. I mean, where were they when I was struggling to find a restaurant on my own after they ghosted me? Now, just three hours before the dinner, they pop up with this alarming news. Right away, I'd be tempted to text Friend A back saying, ""You went radio - silent on me when I needed help, and now you come up with this? How reliable are these Google Reviews anyway?"" I'm skeptical because I remember the restaurant has great reviews from professional food critics. Food critics usually have more in - depth knowledge and experience in evaluating restaurants compared to random diners on Google Reviews. To decide which information is trustworthy, I'd consider the source. Food critics are likely to have visited the restaurant, tasted the food properly, and made a more objective assessment. On the other hand, Google Reviews can be subjective, and it's possible that those who claimed to get food poisoning had other factors contributing to their illness. Before making a final decision, I'd do some extra checks. I'd try to find more recent reviews on other platforms like Yelp or TripAdvisor. I'd also look for any official health inspection reports of the restaurant. If I can't find any red flags from these additional sources, and considering that most nearby venues are full, I'd probably stick with the original booking. After all, I've already paid a non - refundable deposit, and the positive reviews from food critics give me some confidence in the restaurant's quality."
R_4NwhRxEgkSXBV03,"A - thats so annoying i need to find a new restaurant now and ugh my money, why didnt they tell me this before i made a deposit but it is what it is i guess B - id be annoyed at them but id be like oh ok and try to get them to help me find a new place and then just be annoyed at them later C - i would trust them i dont think thered be any reason for me to not D - id tell other people about the inconvenience it was change plans because i dont want people to get sick"
R_9Brhp62AwtSXskk,"I would be annoyed at Friend A for trying to help minute. Afterall, the two of us were supposed to be looking for a restaurant together. If Friend A helped from the beginning, maybe we would have had more information. I would say to Friend A to why he or she was not responding to my messages and all of a sudden you decided to do all this research three hours before the dinner. I would clearly the fault in the lack of effort to try and help yet still have the time to do research and criticize that restaurant I chose. Nevertheless, the dinner is in three hours so I would have to make a decision to either push through with it, reschedule the dinner, or settle for a different restaurant. I would carefully investigate the negative review if it were 'rage bait' or legitimate. I would inspect the review for any exaggerations or extreme biases without any evidence and inspect the person who gave the review. Despite the possibility of food poisoning, I would still push through with the booking since I food critics are more credible sources of information and hope that we won't get food poisoning."
R_9gSCcbS1E3C8iTw,My immediate gut feeling is betrayal but I could consider what my friend is saying. I would say to my friend that I would have appreciated if you would let me know earlier about the reviews. I would look at Google Reviews as they are from people who are not professional so they represent normal diners.
R_9eahWs8Qec76gmd,"When I read Friend A’s message, I felt extremely annoyed and angry. I couldn’t believe they waited until three hours before dinner to bring this up, especially after completely ignoring me when I asked for help weeks ago. If they were so concerned about food safety, why didn’t they say something earlier or better yet, book the restaurant themselves? I would reply right away with something like, “Seriously? You had one job, and you ghosted me when I needed help. Now that I’ve done everything, suddenly you care? If you’re so worried, feel free to find another place yourself. I’m not doing it again.” To be sure, I would contact the restaurant to check if there were any recent food safety complaints. I’d also look at the reviews carefully when were the food poisoning claims posted? Are they verified or just random angry customers? In the end, I would keep the booking. It’s too late to change anything, the deposit is non-refundable, and I already took responsibility when A didn’t. If they don’t want to come, that’s their choice but I’m done handling things for them."
R_962o5xFSw9PbNFZ,"That any place may a food poisoning problem on a random night, and since other places are booked we might as well eat there. I'd say to friend a to not worry and to bring the review as a screenshot to the restaurant.I'd message or call any people I personally know who have eaten at the restaurant for real reviews. I would keep the booking as any place may make a mistake leading to food poisoning, personally I'd eat a steak and ask them to be sure its cooked to my liking, showing them the review and maybe even speaking to the manager on shift before ordering to let them know of the issue in hand."
R_9I5GBWmOLvqXYfX,"I already paid the non-refundable deposit for the booking and food critics have highly rated this restaurant. As with all restaurants, not everyone will have the same dining experience due to a number of variables. Friend A was meant to help out but did not help with choosing the restaurant in the end so Friend A does not get a say in deciding which restaurant to go to. While it is an annoying situation, we are already committed to this restaurant because no one else helped in deciding where to go and I have already incurred a cost in the non-refundable booking. Friend B trusts me enough to allow me to book the restaurant for their birthday, so the only reason for me to change plans is if Friend B tells me so, otherwise we keep the booking despite Friend A's late objection."
R_9qeyHfp7rwmBIii,"Ugh, you’ve got to be kidding me. Three hours before dinner and now Friend A suddenly cares? Where was this energy when I asked for help a month ago? I chased them up, they ghosted me, and I ended up doing everything myself; finding the place, reading reviews, paying the deposit out of my own pocket. And it’s non-refundable too. I remember this place had a good write-up in that food magazine and most of the Google reviews were fine. There were a couple of bad ones, but seriously, every restaurant has a few horror stories. It doesn’t mean it’s a death trap. Also, even if we wanted to change restaurants now, it’s a Saturday night. . I get being cautious, but this just feels like them trying to avoid responsibility again. Honestly, unless someone else wants to fork out hundreds of dollars for a new place and sort a backup plan within the next hour, we’re sticking to the original restaurant. I’m not throwing away the effort I put in or the money"
R_4OUZZKs5XdB6yKX,"In this scenario, I would find Friend A to be quite inconsiderate. My first course of action would be to message them, explaining my perspective of the restaurant having good ratings, as well as a non-refundable deposit. I would also explain that given Friend A's poor response time it was all I could find by myself on short notice. I would then go back over reviews of the place to find evidence supporting my claims around food critic's perspectives and send these to Friend A. I would also then look to see which reviews aligned with their perspective of giving food poisoning and take note of which dishes to potentially avoid to put Friend A's mind at ease. I would choose to keep the booking plans as Friend A should've been more proactive in finding places to book and communicating if they did not want to go to this restaurant."
R_9PRjj1DrQC42Avg,"i’d be upset obviously and kinda pissed like they should’ve said something earlier instead of ghosting me for a whole month, and id tell her that maybe but calmly tell them that “hey so the restaurant got rlly good reviews from critics whose opinions are more relevant than some anecdotal experience and i alr paid a deposit and it’s too late now if u had a problem u could’ve said so sooner”. Maybe id read more of the reviews wherever the friend got the reviews from and id trust my own judgement im quite good at finding restaurants and all. And finally id keep the restaurant cuz theres no other ones gonna be open last minute and i don’t wanna lose my deposit, if ppl actually got food poisoning at it repeatedly the place would be shut down"
R_9n6p2jcdoGyug9Q,A: friend A is a dickhead and should of communicated earlier B: well I paid a non-refundable deposit so we are going C: idk D: just dont order anything too sus
R_9jGTQ6wMqanivsJ,"A. I would be angry because he didn't help me before and now on short time notice he wants to change plans. B. I would ask him where we think we should go. C. Ask him where he got the information from and review its credibility myself. D. I would evaluate friends A character before continuing since I think this would be pretty annoying. Unless friend A had a good place they wanted to go and would arrange a booking, their report about food sickness was correct, I would change as the deposit is a sunk cost."
R_4R3qaCCsYEVJ1wC,"A. Fairly annoyed at friend A for not saying anything earlier especially since they didn't reply to messages. B. I'd probably say something like ""ok, maybe we could ask the group what they think? Just a bit scared we won't be able to get a booking anywhere else this late..."" C. Food critic reviews seem more trustworthy, but also to me any reviews indicating food poisoning would plant a slight seed of doubt, that doesn't tend to be something people lie about. D. I'd probably read the reviews for myself and see if they seem truthful. I'd probably change the plans provided we could get a booking somewhere else, but if not wouldn't cancel as long as the groups okay with it."

R_45Ae219AVS6KIs1,"I don't care actually there's only 3 hours left and no way I'm changing the restaurant. To friend A why at this point u showed me this? Like where were u when I needed your help you were not even there. I don't even beileve what friend A said maybe they are trying to drag me down. I will show up to the restaurant at the booking time will still order and celebrate the birthday. If i chose that restaurant, that means it's good enough and have confidence in myself. I don't care about friend A like why would they showed up at last minute and judged my decision. Since it is non-refundable we will show up and eat , and if food poisoning happen we can sue the restaurant. The food critics are more trustworthy than someone who showed uo and judge my decision at the last minute. Keep the booking because there's only 3 hours left and I'm confident with my decision."
R_9s4teXVhjjfKrPu,"Ugh, are you serious. Now Friend A wants to weigh in, three hours before the dinner? Where was this energy when I asked for help a month ago? I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit, and the place was reviewed well by actual food critics, not just random people on Google Reviews. I get that food poisoning is serious, but online reviews can be so hit-or-miss. One bad night and people go off, I need to be more objective. I want to text Friend A something like, “Appreciate the concern, but I asked you weeks ago for input and didn’t hear back. It’s way too late to change plans now, especially since I paid a deposit and most restaurants are fully booked.”"
R_4wv2qYUqkz8tdtv,"Depends on how close me and Friend A is. If we are not literally best friends, i'll be like whatever and handle it myself. Also depends on how much the deposit is, i'll be pretty sour and think negatively about friend A, however it's likely i'll keep this to myself as it is a non-issue in a grand perspective. Then when friend A ask me about changing restaurant, i'll ask why they haven't contact me earlier and ask more proof about this food poisoning review, if they do have sufficient evidence, i'll ask them what is their plan. If they have a good plan, great, they own up to their mistake and i'll go with it, otherwise i'll call them on their actions. It's likely i'll continue with what i'm doing, friend A is unreliable, a few google reviews can be misleading, and there isnt a lot of options remaining anyways."
R_9MJYOtiXLFLwdGm,"Immediately I would feel annoyed/irritated by Friend A, I would want to yell at them. I would say that they should have considered this before making me choose, as they clearly did not want to and placed the responsibility on me, I would also accuse them of not wanting to eat there in the first place, and finding an excuse to complain. However I would have to consider that the non-refundable booking and reviews do match, but I would look online at specific meals that people who got food poisoning ordered (meat, fish, eggs) and take that into consideration when ordering. Overall I would keep the booking, as I would like to cement to friend A that dumping shared responsibilities without communicating if there were any other outside issues is not something that I value in a friend, and to have to live with the consequences."
R_9AGePJ73L464Cs5,"immediately, i would be extremely pissed off. i hate incompetence and lack of communication, so the fact that they let me know their thoughts so late would anger me. my response would depend on the past experiences i’ve had with this friend. if it’s a friend that has done similar things to this in the past, i would express these thoughts to my friend but not with as much anger but definitely with my feelings. i would tell them that they should’ve spoken to me sooner and collaborated with me more when choosing the restaurant. whereas if it was a friend that would usually not do something like this and is an overall organised person, i would be willing to listen to them (still a bit angry tho). i think i would still stick my foot down and wont change the restaurant. if they were really stubborn or insistent for some reason, id demand for some sort of financial compensation, probably them paying 50% for the payment i had to spend for the booking. overall, i’m not changing the plans because i’m not willing to listen to an irresponsible individual who didn’t bother to communicate with me until this point. also because there’s money involved."
R_9THejfEZJ5ClEBz,"my immediate gut or emotional reaction： Hey, serious? It's only three hours until dinner now, and Friend A just sent a message about the issue of choosing a restaurant? I asked him to book a restaurant together a month ago, but he didn't reply to my messages at all at that time. In the end, I had to handle it all by myself and even paid a non-refundable deposit in advance. Now he just throws over a few screenshots of negative reviews and says, ""Maybe we don't need to go?"" It's really a big deal. keep the booking But if no serious situation is found after checking, I will definitely still follow the original plan. It's too hard to change places at the last minute now. All the other better places must be full, and Friend B will also be very unhappy. The overall reputation of this restaurant is quite good. A few negative reviews are not enough to directly deny it. ** Final decision ** : The original reservation is retained. I don't want everyone's mood to be disrupted, and I still trust this restaurant."
R_9Gt5RTuyE5vjmet,I would still want to go like only a couple of bad reviews compared to the food critics and I think its fair if they haven't messaged me in a while. I would say to friend A that we are still going there and that is finally as it is booked and they have not messaged me in like forever. I choice the critics over my friend because I doubt my friend is a food critic and this is just some google review which I couldn't care less about them. The only extra action I would take before choosing is asking where to go instead and checking with google reviews to see to show that everywhere has bad reviews. My final choice is to go to the place that I have already booked and friend A has to suck it up as it is for a birthday for not him.
R_4JkL95GKekfufeE,"It reminds me of an old friend of mine who lacked communication and then believed we could all work around them when they talked to us last minutes so I would be very frustrated at them for not talking sooner and overstepping when I was the one who put in the effort to find a place. I feel like there would be more of a reason behind their decision of not wanting to go to this restaurant so I would let them know that I chose the restaurant because of good food critic reviews and rather than starting an argument, ask if there is any other reasons they don't want to go to this restaurant and remind them it is too late to move after the deposit and the late notice, if they would like to change restaurant's I would expect the deposit to be split between us and for them to find and book the restaurant by themself for us all as I wouldn't want to put in the same effort again."
R_9226mr5TyVYQkSJ,"When I saw friend A’s message, I was shocked and a bit annoyed. Why is A sending this to me now, just three hours before dinner? They didn’t help at all when I was planning it! I replied to A and asked, “Where did you see this review? Is it recent? Just one person said they got food poisoning—was it serious?” I also checked Google Reviews myself. Most of them were very good. I even found some new reviews from this week that said the food was great. To be safe, I called the restaurant and asked if they had any recent issues with food safety. They told me everything was fine, and no one else complained. That made me feel more confident. Since I already paid a non-refundable deposit and there is no solid proof the restaurant is dangerous, I decided to stick with the plan. I trust the overall good reviews and the restaurant’s response. Changing now would be too late and too stressful."
R_9OMQKOT05YB7OWZ,"A. I would be happy knowing that my friend didn't ghost me intentionally but was probably busy with something. But a part of me would be pissed that friend A wasn't being cooperative, and that I paid for the dinner already, as it's non - refundable. I'd honestly tell friend A to let me see how many google reviews mentioned food poisoning, and see if they were frequent or not. The time stamps matter as well, because i'd look at how long ago the critiques were made, and when the reviews were made. Now i'd also look into the dishes in the review that caused the food poisoning, and would see if it's something easily irritable to the stomach. If there were no dishes mentioned, i'd check the other reviews of the person who wrote the google review to see if it was similar. Honestly, as it is friend B's birthday, i'd call them and ask what they would prefer, as it's their birthday."
R_4dNq3BiOufhobBG,I would tell Friend A that we are going to the place I booked because they did not respond to me and I had to make a decision in order to celebrate Friend B's birthday. Unless Friend A can give me another booking within the hour I would not change my mind. I would also be very annoyed with Friend A as they had ample time to help choose but they left it to the last minute. I would also trust the food critics over the google reviews as they are much more reliable. There is no way to change plans within 3 hours of going to the booking and I would tell Friend A that they should've told me sooner. I would keep the booking for the main reason that there is no time to change it and food critics are more reliable.
R_99czvMc8kHQ3LrS,"I would think about saying well, I already booked the restaurant so I can't really change that now since there is a non-refundable deposit, unless you're OK with paying me back that money. Also I would go back to Google and look at the reviews, if I was right and there were good reviews and would screenshot the reviews and send them to my friend. If they were bad reviews, I would not send them to my friend and instead say that when I booked it, there was already good reviews when I looked. Also if they really cared, they would've also gone to look at the reviews at the same time as me and responded to my message. My emotional reaction would be feeling guilty at first but then realising that actually there's nothing we can do about it now so there is no need to stress about it."
R_4PStGe5Wwc9r9wn,"You’ve been MIA for a whole month when I asked for help, and now, three hours before the dinner, you suddenly pop back up with bad reviews? And not even your own concerns — just screenshots. Where was this energy when we were trying to plan something for Friend B? I feel a bit of panic too — what if the reviews are legit? I don’t want to risk getting anyone sick, especially not Friend B on their birthday. But also… I booked this place, I paid the deposit, and I remember reading solid reviews from food critics. I trusted those more than random one-star complaints. I text Friend A back: “I appreciate the heads-up, but this is super last-minute. I read plenty of positive reviews, including critic ones. Did you find an alternative that isn’t fully booked?” I’m trying to stay civil, even though I’m seething. To double-check, I Google the restaurant again and look at multiple review sites — not just Google, but also TripAdvisor and maybe even Reddit or any recent local food blogs. I also check the dates on the bad reviews: were they clustered together? From years ago? If there’s a legit pattern of recent food poisoning, I’ll consider switching. If nothing looks alarming, I’m sticking with the booking. I won’t risk throwing the whole night into chaos based on one message three hours out. Worst case, I’ll give Friend B a heads-up when we get there and make sure everyone orders cautiously. But I’m not letting Friend A derail the whole plan without real evidence — especially when they bailed until now."
R_9Cwy2vDo2WFQ4Zc,"a. a little bit frustrated, inconvenient and unnecessary chimming in. it nice that friend A wants to help, but it is too little to late, that's a bit annoying. coming out of nowher,e providing useless feedback at an unhelpful time. b. ""hey, yeah i see what you are saying, but i did extensivly check the reviews before booking and it looks like that was jsut a one-off thing. ive already booked this current place and my booking is non refundable. would it be ok if we just give this place a try think it could be really nice. if we get there and the vibes are off wecan change it up. c. im assuming that because i booked this so far in advance, i would have previously and carefully checked reviews. i would have also compared options. ultimately i would suggest we stick with the origional booking just to give it a go becuase most other places would be booked i had done the previous research and if we show up and have a bad feeling we can always change in that moment. no point disaster planning yet"
R_9VVId9C8Vj2ELgR,"I feel frustrated that I was forced to organise the dinner by myself and now my friend is critiquing it even though they had no participation. I would not say anything to friend A to spoil their dinner, but would be cautious about friend B and potentially bring the situation up at a later date if it was appropriate. I would trust my own research and my opinion of the resturant, potentially looking it up again but still believing my own judgement. At this point in time, and without friend B's input, they don't really have a leg to stand on to judge my choice. I would ultimately stick with my decision, online reviews are often very specific to a particular issue and not always indicative of the resturant as a whole."
R_9mIfEpQTVIhg4xA,I am immediately annoyed at reading the text as the friend hadn't provided any help earlier. I then start to feel concern that ive chosen the wrong place but dont have time to book another. I would then look up the resturant again and read the reviews to see how recent the negative/positive ones are. After looking at this i would then text the friend back stating the reviews ive seen and the lack of available resturants to book due to the time. If the reviews were still mostly positive I would push to still go to the booked resturant.
R_9GldOeU6ucCe2Db,"Did friend B send a message? I would feel annoyed right after reading friend A's message. She did not help me find any restaurant, and now she is saying maybe we shouldn't go... without any type of apology and she did not consider that I paid for the deposit. I would make her pay me bakc half of the deposit as it was also her responsibility to find and book a resturaunt for Friend B's birthday. She should also find another restaraunt before saying we shouldn't go. I would not try too hard to decide whether teh information is trustworthy, I would just take her word for it because food poisoning is quite serious and it is not worth the risk. My final choilce would be to change plans but make friend A pay me back half of the deposit."
R_9ux0IL7wacVYq9v,"A. Uhmm, what the heck. My gut says to just try the restaurant because all the other restaurants are full and it's too late, and if the food is bad atleast there is memories from it. It's kind of upsetting that they didn't respond until 3 hours before the dinner. Very frustrating to have been put in this situation B. Hey, sorry for booking the dinner but I think it might be too late to cancel/refund, because there is a non-refundable deposit and just because there is a few bad reviews doesn't mean its entirely bad, because I've seen some good reviews too. Maybe we can try out the good dishes they reccomend and if its absolutely ridiculous we can always go out again another time or go to another place C. Both seem reasonable, but cross referencing which dishes, time thhe reviews were posted and authenticity of the food credits will also count. D. Hmm, discuss a little bit with friend B what they would want to do aswell cause realistically their birthday aswell. Keep the booking, but be wary with what we choose, maybe avoiding the said ""bad dishes"" and trying out the ""good ones"" and seeing if it's really reflecting the critics."
R_4MbxplCaVt3pXFw,"A. I am irritated that Friend A waits until the last minute to have a say regarding the restaurant. If she wanted to do something she should have contributed earlier, but considering she did not do anything prior to 3hrs before the dinner, I would proceed with the plan. B. I would tell her that its too late to make changes and there's nothing we can do. C. I don't really rely on Google Reviews, I would trust food critiques, they are qualified at their job D. I would check the restaurant's social media pages on any updates regarding food poisoning. Ultimately, I would keep the booking."
R_4MRBxwG8obndACB,"a. i would feel frustrated and a little annoyed. b. i would say something like 'i already booked this place and its too late to book another place. you should have showed me that before. ' c. i would cross-reference with other sources of information, such as reviews, blogs, social media posts etc. i would also discredit the friend because of what they did . d. i would check the posts about the restaurant and especially if they have food health and safety awards or the general cleanliness of the restaurant would suffice. i would be confident in my choice by choosing the initial restaurant because its too late for another and the deposit was non-refundable."
R_9fAvOKufoGRbRrp,"The credibility of negative reviews is low: Only one Google review mentioned food poisoning, but the overall rating of the restaurant remained high (such as above 4 stars), and it was recommended by food critics, suggesting that the problem might be an isolated case or an exaggeration. Changing the plan is riskier: As dinner time approaches, nearby restaurants are likely to be fully occupied. Making a last-minute change might result in a worse experience (such as long queues, poor service). The loss of the deposit is not worthwhile: The non-refundable deposit has already been paid. If there is no conclusive evidence to prove that the restaurant has systematic safety issues, cancelling it is unreasonable. Take the initiative to reduce risks: After arriving at the venue, observe the hygiene conditions, avoid consuming raw food or high-risk dishes, and ensure a safe gathering."
R_9Eh6wBy1P9GdA0y,Honestly I think friend A is just annoying and being a flaker. I would’ve just confronted them about their behaviour. I would’ve trusted the reviews online if there’s a lot. I would keep the booking
R_9EAXEBJRdiCSmK3,"When I first saw A’s message with the screenshot, my immediate reaction was: “Seriously? You tell me this now?” I felt really annoyed because I had asked for their help a month ago and they ignored me. Now, just three hours before dinner, they suddenly bring this up. Even though I was upset, I’d probably hold back and reply with something like, “Really? I remember seeing a lot of good reviews before,” just to stay calm on the surface. Next, I would immediately check Google and other review platforms myself to see if there were more recent reports about food poisoning or if it was just one or two random bad reviews. I’d also go back to see what the professional food critics said, since I remember this restaurant being highly rated. If possible, I would message a friend who has been there recently and ask about their experience. At the same time, I’d look to see if there’s any chance of finding another restaurant at short notice, though three hours before dinner is really tight. If we really have to change, I would ask A and B to share the cost of the non-refundable deposit. After thinking about it, I would keep the original booking. The main reasons are that the majority of reviews are still positive, a single screenshot isn’t reliable, it’s too late to find another place, and I don’t want to waste the deposit I already paid."
R_9UhzOhoJjpcAbBV,"a. Reading his situation Friend A frustrated and irritated me in the sense that she had no contribution to group management but yet had something to say. However I also had the understanding that the sudden food poisoning alerts were out of her control and the timing of the situation was just unlucky. Her suggestion that they shouldn't go anymore was purely with the intention to avoid the risk of getting illness, which is completely understandable. However, I still feel frustrated because it would be invalidating for the friend who planned everything and put in a non-refundable deposit. b. I'd tell her I understand and try to communicate with her that I had already paid a non-refundable deposit and possibly that case of food poisoning could be an anomaly and one-time event. Especially since when restaurants are notified of potential risk, they would change their ways and be more cautious to prevent public criticism and risk inducing a poor reputation. c. Depends on the quantity; for instance, if there were multiple Google reviews, I would be understanding. However, it is very common for restaurants to have incidents here and there all the time. And it depends on how recent the review was, etc. D. I'd call the restaurant to ask if they've implemented any risk management procedures and if they were aware of a food poisoning incident. I'd be open to looking for an alternative; however, it is purely dependent on circumstance. For instance, if there are no bookings left, I'd go to my original plan, and if only one customer had reported food poisoning from a restaurant that is highly regarded by food critics, it probably is a restaurant that would most likely prevent further issues from occurring. still go, restaurants venues are usually booked out at night and if this food poisoning was a one time"
R_9E6o1UR695yWgg2,"I think Friend A is an abololute slacker and if they wanna be picky they shouldve pulled their weight but they didn't so they can suck it up. I would tell them how late it is to be changing plan and also it's not about how they feel it's about Friend B and they can just starve to death if they dont wanna eat. Also there are so many ways to get sick there's no way to tell how they got the food poisoning and maybe Friend A should stfu because some people actually do stuff other than whinge and be flaky. I'd keep the plans, unless Friend B said otherwise, and if they did, I'd be quietly pissed off."
R_92XU34cSilT3AQN,"A. i would be a bit nervous because I don't want food poisoning, but i'd also be annoyed because she should have told me this earlier. i will tell her this. then i will look at the reviews myself. if there are many reviews about this issue, i will cancel, and ask the friend to split the deposit with me."
R_9RwGhSUWehXvsi5,"Initally I'd be really annoyed! Why on earth would you give this kind of info so near the time. I'd suggest that we take a look at more reviews and that I don't always trust these anyone, anyone only reports negative, no one responds positively to these things! Say let's go ahead with it, keep our fingers crossed it's OK and if not make it in to a fun night, somethign we can talk about. However, I would say, next time you're in charge of booking!"
R_4Y5S3VXplJ1LQNH,"I would be annoyed, and ask friend A to think about the larger number of food crtics that have positively rated the restaurant so it will likely be fine. I would also express frustration at friend A and ask them how they expect us to make plans when they ignored my messages for a month. I would also explain that theres a non-refundable deposit that was paid and that i would much prefer to keep the current reservation. If friend A is extremely reluctant, i would cancel plans entirely if they responded in a defensive manner when i called them out about their bad reply game and inconsideration for me and ask Friend A to pay half of the deposit. If friend A was understanding of my frustration, i would be happy to find somewhere else to go, but would also ask for half of the deposit. My first preference would be to keep the original reservation."
R_4aIWiOxJLzXshwJ,"My immediate reaction would be irritation and confusion - if Friend A didn't bother to choose the restaurant in the first place, why should they be picky about it now? It feels like they are being insincere too, since the restaurant has great reviews. Perhaps they simply don't like the choice - however, if they didn't, they should've brought it up with me prior. I would ask Friend A why they didn't bring it up with me earlier, as it's too late to cancel (including getting a deposit back). I would also ask if they have heard any negative things firsthand about the place. If not, I would explain my perspective and situation, and how I would want to keep the booking due to the investment of time and money I put in. I would choose in the end to keep the booking, but make it clear to Friend A that my choice is not because I don't trust their judgement, as I dislike hurting others' feelings through confrontation."
R_47BcUqTx8qqGiax,"When I received A’s message, my first reaction was frustration. I had asked for help a month ago, and A never responded—now they suddenly question the restaurant hours before the dinner? I felt a mix of anxiety and irritation, especially because I had already paid a non-refundable deposit. Still, I tried to stay calm. I searched online for the same reviews A mentioned. I found one report of suspected food poisoning, but it wasn’t clear if it was the restaurant’s fault. I also noticed that the restaurant still had many recent positive reviews, especially from food critics. That made me question whether A’s concern was based on solid evidence or just panic. I texted A and explained that I had already made the booking due to their silence, and changing the plan now would be difficult. I reassured them that I had looked into the reviews again and didn’t find convincing reasons to cancel. In the end, I decided to stick with the original plan. The restaurant still seemed trustworthy, and it felt unfair to change everything last-minute after all the effort I made."
R_44HKb6nrJlMLXVL,"A. I would feel quite frustrated considering that I have already done all the work. But overall I dont really care because I've already decided, and paid for it myself so they have no right to object. B. I'd say that its too late considering I've already decided, and that it shouldn't matter too much considering I have already done my part. What they found was most likely a fluke. C. I'd rather take information from critics and professionals rather than recent google reviews, or any low-rated google review for that matter, considering all restaurants have them. D. I would have researched for restaurants, depending on the vibe, look, food, and reviews from actual professionals. I would also check reviews from google, I just wouldn't nitpick on details in low rated reviews I would keep the booking because I already paid a non-refundable book, my friend responded too late, so I get to pick."
R_4G6rO6u8exqtpAV,"Wow. Seriously? Three hours before the dinner and now Friend A sends this? After ghosting me when I asked for help weeks ago? I’m honestly pretty pissed off. I’ve been stressing about this for a month, ended up booking it all myself, paid the non-refundable deposit — and suddenly they care? And about something they found on Google Reviews? It just feels a bit inconsiderate and honestly kind of cowardly to drop this so last minute. My first instinct is to snap back like, “Where was this energy when I needed help a month ago?” But I know that’s not helpful right now. I’d probably reply with something more composed like: “I saw that review too, but it’s one of like hundreds and most of them are great. It’s a bit too late to change now, but if you're really worried, feel free to sit this one out.” I’ll do a quick check anyway, just in case — scan the most recent reviews, see if that food poisoning comment is a one-off or part of a pattern. Maybe hop on the restaurant’s social media to see if they’ve posted anything weird recently. If anything seems seriously off, I’ll reconsider — but honestly, I trust the food critics more than some random angry Yelp user from two years ago. I’m keeping the booking. It’s too late to change plans, and the place still seems solid overall. It’s not perfect, but this is Friend B’s birthday, and I’m not going to let one panicked message ruin it. If Friend A doesn’t want to come, that’s on them."
R_4ZCEWgUy4gJ1QFO,"I would feel annoyed and call my friend an idiot for not saying anything in a month and cancelling 3 hours before. But there is always a solution so I would try to call the restaurant to ask if I could cancel the booking despite it already saying that its non-depositable. Restaurant says can cancel: i cancel, look for another place and call my mate for approval. If the restaurant says no: if the booking price was cheap like $50 or under, i would just book another restaurant and lose the money whatever. if it wasnt cheap, i would check how long ago this google review was made, whether it looks like someone credible had written it, look at their other google reviews. i would also check what other google reviewers have said about the restaurant. then i would text my mate and say it should be fine because the google reviewer looks stupid and all the other reviews say the restaurant is fine. if the friend still doesnt reply i will give them a call. if they dont pick up and they havent given a solution, then i will go forward with the dinner. if all of the google reviews say that the restaurant is bad, i will probably just sack the money and book somewhere else and tell my mate that they made a good call and apologise for not double checking the validity of the restaurant. theres too many factors to consider when making the final choice so idk"
R_9BJxT7iJnxHaxDr,"Oh no, I can’t believe this is happening just three hours before dinner. I’m honestly frustrated that Friend A is only getting back to me now, especially after ignoring my messages when I needed help planning. I already paid the deposit, and we don’t really have time to rebook somewhere else last minute. I’d probably text her back something like: “Where was this info earlier? I already paid for the booking, and the place has great critic reviews. I’ll double-check, but this is really late to raise it.” I’d also want to fact-check those reviews myself. Are those claims about food poisoning just a few one-star reviews? Or is there a pattern? I’d check the most recent Google and TripAdvisor reviews, maybe even the restaurant’s social media to see if they’ve posted anything or responded to complaints. If I can’t find solid proof of a problem, I’m inclined to go ahead. So my final choice is to keep the booking. It’s too late to make other arrangements, and there’s no strong evidence the restaurant is unsafe. I’ll ask Friend A to decide whether she’s still comfortable coming, but I’m not cancelling on Friend B’s birthday."
R_9YXG5Y4dTM4mSn2,"When reading Friend A's message that we shouldn't go, I would feel annoyed because they left the planning to me without any explanation, then wants to change the plans at the last minute when they can't exactly be changed. However I would try and put this aside, and ask them whether there's a lot of other good reviews on the site of diners who didn't get food poisoning. I would also ask when the reviews were posted, as if they were recent then I would ask Friend B if they're ok with still going to the restaurant, or if they'd rather go somewhere else since it's their birthday. I would also tell Friend A that we've already paid a deposit, and if they're unsure then we can order food that has less chance of causing food poisoning. If the bad reviews are old or outnumbered, then I would keep the booking. If the reviews are recent or there is a significant amount of them, then I would consult with Friend B and probably change plans."
R_9OBJ6XMuIvupbBT,
R_41tqrr81pmslC2o,"Ugh… seriously? Three hours before dinner and Friend A suddenly decides to bring this up? I’m honestly kind of annoyed that they completely ghosted me when I asked for help weeks ago, and now they want to chime in last minute? That’s frustrating and feels pretty unfair. I already paid a non-refundable deposit, and now this? I’d probably respond to Friend A with something like, “Hey, I get your concern, but I really wish you’d brought this up earlier. The booking is set and I already paid for it.” I’d try not to sound too angry, but I’d definitely be honest. Final choice: I’d keep the booking. The timing is too last-minute to make new plans, the deposit is gone either way, and I trust the professional reviews more than a few bad anecdotes. Plus, Friend B deserves a smooth and enjoyable birthday and stressing about this hours before won’t help anyone."
R_9MXiwwiMAMXAFTb,"Oh my god, why did that happen!? Superised, disappointed, and a little bit angry. What should I do now? Yep, i should check when that review posted. then, if it happened in the last week ,i will change the place quickly. but whether the time, ill go for telling her i paid a lot of money on the booking."
R_410cYNjEF8U3sUw,"Oh shit! Can't afford getting food poisoning. Not safe to take everyone. Can we shift the venue to some other restaurant? Let me go check the reviews by food critics, because that should be a reliable source."
R_41mv5PqgOB4V5eO,"My immediate reaction would be that Friend A simply doesn't want to go to the place I selected. Regardless of these reviews, she chose to ignore the good ones. Hence, it feels as if there are ulterior motives; she possibly wanted to act as a hero and 'outshine' me, to make a more favourable impression on Friend B. A lot of places do have bad reviews, and it's easy to avoid certain meals if you're paranoid. It isn't fair to discredit critics and a restaurant by only trusting a few Google reviews. If it was such an issue, she could have researched it prior before I booked and made more of an effort to find a place that she was also satisfied with. I could have made more efforts to read the reviews; however, I did see the critic reviews, which should suffice. I will keep the booking, as if there was an issue, she could have brought it up to me earlier rather than last minute."
R_9S8kFXSoliHXPI0,"I would feel frustrated as friend A has ghosted me for months but suddenly appeared and disrupting my plans. I would tell friend A that I have already paid deposit for it so there is no other option but go to the restaurant I have book. in deciding information that is trustworthy, I would read and compare the overall google comments and decide whether the restaurant is worth visiting. I would keep the booking. This is not only because of that I have paid a non-refundable deposit, but also the fact that a single comment of the restaurant has food poisoning might not be trustworthy. Moreover, friend A only rejected my plan but did not give out alternative solutions, giving me no reasons to change my plan."
R_9ErPXg9B4fMpOaU,"I would feel irritated as Friend A did not contribute to the conversation and only decided to abruptly chime in before the event. This lacks communication and implies their lack of consideration and care on behalf of others. I would tell them that it's non-refundable and we would have to attend as it's inconsiderate to change plans right before the event. I would offer an ultimatum, if friend A is able to find an alternative restaurant and pay their share (the full fee) of the booking, we could consult with friend B and find an alternative place instead. The chances of that it unlikely though as it's hard to negotiate and find alternative time and place again. In regards to the restaurants review, if the OVERALL impression of the restaurant is good then it's best to attend it either way. The likely hood of food poisoning is rare and it applies for EVERY restaurant. Personally, I would've stuck with the same booking if the Friend A isn't willing to pay for the full fee on the alternative restaurant."
R_4eWcXmeJCwN6sdV,"The situation would make me upset and angry with Friend A. I would see the situation as rude and inconsiderate, even if they didn't have that itention. Right away, I would probably send a rash message to Friend A because I would be frustrated and stressed. If i was really upset by the situation I would tell Friend A to sort it out themselves, however I may feel bad and wouldn't want to ruin Friend B's birthday. It would also depend how legit the food posining message was, like if it was from 5 years ago and no other messages that agree or say the same thing. If there were legit food critics that said the place was good, I'd be inclined to discard the bad reviews, also the deposit would make me think the resturant must be pretty nice/ fancy. I would probably ultimately ask Friend A what they would want to do, but if the despoit had to be paid I was ask Friend B to split it."
R_9zVyPAZgzVC56Yp,"we're still going to go to this restaurant. You didn't respond to my messages until 3 hours before we were going when we were planning it for a whole month. I would rather trust food critics whose job it is to judge food over some random person on google critics ""claiming"" to get food poisoning from their meal. Plus the surrounding restaurants are already full and I already paid for the reservation and can't get my money back. We're eating at this restaurant cause you haven't responded to my texts, there's no place else to go and I already paid for it and can't get a refund."
R_4X1cMCJsXh1khRi,"i'll be angry. friend A has all his time to simply respond to my text. and now he's complaining that we should not go. i'll look at the reviews myself. if the food poisoning reviews are not even that bad, i might think this is just another excuse from friend A for not wanting to go. i don't think i can stop myself from thinking badly of A since he gave me a bad impression in the first place. however, if the reviews are actually that bad, i will follow up if the government-related kitchen checks gave that restaurant a visit. If they had, the restaurant is probably still safe to go. if they have not, i might not go and let friend A decide on a restaurant himself. if friend A does not reply to my message again, i'll book a restaurant for just me and friend B, excluding friend A. I don't think friend A and my friendship will ever stay the same again."
R_4pzNbMaAStZDdZc,"I would definitely be frustrated receiving the message from Friend A. I think I would have to step back for a second before replying to make sure I didn’t say anything I would regret. Considering how late it is, I would guess that the deposit would be lost by this point, and therefore I would be losing that money if we didn’t go to the restaurant. It’s difficult to say whether or not the food critics or the google reviews are more trustworthy, so I think I would ignore the reviews entirely considering it’s so last minute. Ultimately, I think I would tell Friend A that we should keep the booking. I would tell them that if they wanted to have a look around for another restaurant then they were more than welcome, but they would have to help me pay for the deposit for the other restaurant. At the end of the day its most important that Friend B enjoys their birthday, but I would make it clear that I should not be paying for the last minute change of plans alone. If Friend A did not want to pay for the deposit, I would reiterate that we should then keep the booking."
R_4d0qm12JJ7lAD6Z,"i would be immediately pressed at friend A and text/speak to them passive aggressively asking why she couldn't have been so avidly researching before i made the deposit. considering that she is evidently not a trustworthy friend, she is likely an equally untrustworthy source and so i would confirm these food poisoning allegations myself. if they were true and from multiple sources/reviews, i would then ask her what she wants to do about the non-refundable deposit, heavily implying that i will not be paying for it entirely, actually this would depend on how hefty the deposit was. scenario a (hefty deposit): if she is kind enough to take on some of deposit then i would be happy to switch restaurants if there was one to her liking, otherwise i would snitch to any other friends involved/invited and probably keep the booking out of spite. scenario b (smaller deposit): i would be a kind gracious friend and start looking for restaurants with less health risks, hopefully find one and switch the booking"
R_98LEQQbG1QLjGs9,"The immediate reaction is annoyance/frustration, because Friend A didn't help me book the restaurant and it's my money he will waste by not showing up. First I'd ask him why he didn't respond to my texts initially, and I'd want a decent reason for that. I'd tell Friend A that we'd better go regardless of reviews as I've already paid and it's non-refundable. If he still doesn't want to show up, I'd ask him to pay me back half the amount. Deciding which information is trustworthy and which checks/actions to take is a little more difficult. I'd need to see whether the poisoning incidents were isolated to a certain period, whether or not the restaurant had responded to them, and I'd figure out which dishes the victims ordered and make a note not to get them myself. I'd also need to look at when the critic reviews were posted and the content within them, which dishes they rate highly etc. I'd tell Friend A that we could order based on this information."
R_439cnIgNhLdMTUI,"Immediately I would investigate into the google reviews tbat claim of getting food poisoning. Validity would be checked by the amount of reviews these individuals have given, how long ago these reviews were put and what other reviewers have said on google reviews. Following this, I would make a subjective decision whether the claims are valid right now. I would also check the reviews that have been given on other platforms, such as tripadvisor. If there is a pattern of a specific food giving food poisoning, then I would say to Friend A that we will just avoid that meal and order something else from there. If Friend A is still insisting on not having that restaurant, then I would tell them that the booking has already been made, and a deposit has been given. If they are willing to get a booking and take responsibility for finding another restaurant, then I am happy to change plans, else we will keep this booking."
R_4kM44HpIMuSFtsQ,"a) i would feel very upset. If they cared so much about the food we ate why didnt they suggest anything before. 3 hours before is too short notice, as as long as nothing isnt raw it should be fine. b) i would say; 'hey, i planned this by myself. Its too late to get anything else and i would have appreciated if you communicated this earlier. Next time please help me choose these plans to avoid this again' c) I just wouldnt care, i would just avoid meaty/ fishy foods d) I would just go with my restaurant, its too late. I would double check the reviews. Often people leave bad reviews if the service was bad and not if it was good. I would keep the booking. It is far too late to change any plans and Friend A was being irresponsible with my planning time. further, i was doing it out of my own free time, it doesn't have to be perfect"
R_9RvC2KWwEic82Dm,"I would immediately feel very frustrated and angry regarding Friend A's response, accounting for the fact that they did not respond or acknowledge my previous message that I had sent. In this situation, I would be very emotional and stressed considering the lateness of the response. In response to Friend A, I would start by mentioning how they had not offered any input or assistance of any kind; however, I would then ask Friend A if they would have any ideas or alternatives. To determine which source of information is most trustworthy, I would compare the number of negative reviews with the more positive reviews to gauge which is more prevalent. I would also check the dates of said reviews, seeing if the food poisoning review is outdated, as the restaurant may have made improvements."
R_4FxFPJXtfIewh7W,"immediate gut/emotional reaction of how it is not fair for friend A to be sending a message like that when it is so last minute. i believe that that message implies that we should go somewhere else, but it is already the day of and the booking has already been made. we had a long time to plan/discuss/research about where we should go, yet they didn't contribute, so they don't get the right to randomly get their two cents right before the party happens and we listen to them. I would say something along the lines of ""oh no that's not good, but i do remember looking at reviews before showing more positive responses, and its too late now to change venues"". i wouldn't really care about which information is trustworthy, i would still want to go to the restaurant that was initially booked, just out of spite of them (and their lack of work)."
R_41KlBJpdsWwJ4wV,"A. My gut feeling would be anger and annoyance. Frustrated by why the person completely ignored my texts when I asked for help booking, and now they suddenly swoop in with screenshots warning about food poisoning. Would also want to mention that they could’ve mentioned this when I was organising everything. B. Looking closer, the screenshots are just from random Google users. I know how unreliable those can be and there are chance that this might not even be related to the restaurant. C. I remind myself the restaurant has been praised by food critics, which holds much more weight. Still, I want to be sure, so I would check other platforms. D. No i wouldnt change my plan, just because some reviews were bad doesn't mean it will happen to everyone and plus at this point, changing plans would be chaos. Most nearby places are fully booked, the deposit is non-refundable, and there’s no convincing evidence this restaurant is unsafe. My decision: keep the booking. I’ll reassure Friend A and Friend B, explain the critic reviews, and move forward because one or two dodgy reviews aren’t enough to ruin Friend B’s birthday dinner."
R_4rVmGuGDOlDTrA8,"Oh my GOD, are you kidding me right now?! Three hours before dinner and NOW you decide to chime in? I'm honestly so frustrated. Like, where were you a month ago when I actually NEEDED your help? I had to find this place by myself, put down my own money for the deposit, and now you're trying to sabotage it last minute with some random Google reviews? My first instinct is to text back something sarcastic like ""Thanks for the 11th hour input"" but I need to think this through for Friend B's sake. Okay, let me look at these screenshots properly. Google Reviews can be unreliable - anyone can post anything. These could be fake reviews or just people having bad experiences that aren't representative. The food critics I read had actual credentials and probably more rigorous standards. I'm going to quickly check if these reviews show up on other platforms like Yelp too. If there's a genuine food safety issue, it would probably appear across multiple sites, right? I should also see if these are recent reviews. But honestly, what are my realistic options here? It's three hours before dinner - most decent places will be booked solid for weekend service. And I'd lose my deposit. I am keeping the booking."
R_4IcXnJCqG7enIII,"Seriously? Three hours before the dinner? This is the first time Friend A’s messaging me about this after ghosting me a month ago when I asked for help. And now they suddenly care enough to send Google Reviews screenshots? Honestly, I’m frustrated. I’ve already put down a non-refundable deposit and organised everything because they went quiet. Where was this energy when we were trying to plan? As I already paid the deposit and there are limited options left at this point. Also, most of the reviews I saw were positive, including from professional critics. I'll keep the booking."
R_4gTwmzU00VQzFGG,"I would feel frustrated. I needed support moths ago when i was originally booking. It is nice that they want tohelp but frankly this timing is just undermining the original plan, showing little trust in my planning and the persons actions are not supportive as they didnt provide an alternative option. I would respect the input a bit more if it seemed like they were genuinely trying to help and provideconstructive feedback not doubt. I would tell them that iu appreciate their concern and hear them however i did do my own research and have seen lots of positive feedback from trusted food critiques, i would essentially try to reassure them of my choice and suggest that we just give the place a try and if we really catch a bad vibe we can pivot then, especially given the timing. I would trust my research as i am sure i would have looked into many places and chosen the one i trust and think looks best."
R_9SrwGFpW1NuWcTL,My immedaite emotional response would be anger and fustration as friend A did not contribute to help. I would tell Friend A it would be too late to find another venue and call him useless and how he would be no position to have a say. I would call him lazy and stupid for looking at food reviews and if he was so picky to go pick himself. I would not trust a food review that states food poisoning and trust a critic more.
R_4mlxyaZfyHqzoIs,"Friend A should have brought these concerns up when we were discussing options, it is now too late. I would say to friend A 'you shiuld have been more involved and your laziness has affected the decision making, it should'nt be solely up to me'. I am trusting the numerous reviews saying the restaurant is good rather than 1 instance of food poisoning, this is not cause for concern yet. Google reviews are not always truthful anyway. I would look at the reviews myself and see if they are legitimate and also look at when they were written, this could be old information that has since become a non-issue. I decide to keep the booking, there is not enough cause for concern, i have paid a deposit, and there is not enough time to find a new location. If the food is off we can leave and improvise a new plan."
R_9D0H2cidGGIgHTk,"When I first saw Friend A’s message, I felt frustrated and anxious. After all, they ignored my messages when I asked for help, and now, just three hours before dinner, they suddenly raise concerns. My immediate thought was, “Why now?” especially after I already paid a non-refundable deposit. I would probably respond by saying, “I understand your concern, but I wish you had brought this up earlier. We’re very close to the dinner time, and it’s too late to make major changes.” To decide whether to trust the reviews, I’d compare the dates of the negative and positive reviews. If the food poisoning claims are recent and repeated, that’s a red flag. But if they’re old or seem exaggerated, I’d trust the food critics and my original decision. As an extra step, I might call the restaurant to ask if they’ve had recent complaints or check social media for any mentions. In the end, I’d likely keep the booking. The restaurant has great reviews from reliable sources, and changing plans now would be too risky and stressful, especially since most other places are fully booked."
R_4ps1aBwfiUlBGgw,"A. Are you kidding?!? first you stop helping me plan and now you're gonna critic my choice, even tho you had no decency to even attempt to help me. I have also paid a nonrefundable deposit for this, ugh! is honestly so annoying and lowkey disrespectful. B. Sorry but I already paid the deposit and the reviews from food critics say it is a really good restaurant. If you had said before I booked we definitely could have changed, but it's bit late now. C. I have already chosen and the fact I had to pay a deposit shows this restaurant is quite fancy compared to others, I feel like it is quite this restaurant would not have food poisoning. D. no, once my mind is set. It is set and the food critics prove that it sounds like a good restaurant and unlikely that there would be food poisoning."
R_3nIZ7fgaHieiBpZ,"Concerned because any reviews that say food poisoning is pretty worrisome, even if there are great reviews so id check the reviews again myself because friend A might be looking at the wrong thing. Id tell Friend A that ill check it again myself and to just wait till I finish doing so and to look for another restaurant in the area just in case. IF the bad reviews are real id leave and if they aren't stay and tell friend A that they're stupid and merrily go eat altogether. I can only make sure if I see the information with my own eyes and as Friend A did ghost the messages before id be more skeptical but not mad."
R_43bHQ8gIy43Qqn7,"A. A little disappointed that my money got wasted, but it's overall fine. B. Ask if he has any other options in mind C. I would keep to myself that it most likely is selection bias, as there probably is a small number of people who got food poisoning compared to the general consumer. D. Maybe I would explain that to him about the small amount of reviews, the booking will be kept until an alternative resturant is found."
R_41jSm6yTj5RoCxr,I would feel confused and worried about what to do next. However I would probably tell them that we should still go anyway as there isn't much we can do 3 hours before. I would trust reviews from food critics as they would have more experience and could provide trustworthy detail. I would probably call Friend B and ask her for her opinions. I would finally chose to keep the booking because I have already paid for it and I wouldn't want it to go to waste.
R_9VNIBkBFb8rdq4G,"My immediate reaction is disappointment at the lack of clearance or correspondence regarding their disaffection towards the choice of venue. The first statement I would make is ""You haven't given me enough notice, this is non-refundable"", as well as ""Please consider these reviews and available evidence"". To decide trustworthiness, I would consider the merit/rationale of the argument, the source's credibility, as well as the context of the evaluations. An extra check I would make is to run the reviews through an ""AI review"" detector or check if the business has a coercive review scheme. My final choice is to keep the booking."
R_9i3WqkbyXzPIOUM,"A. my immediate emotional reaction to Friend A's late response is frustration. B. I would tell Friend A about the non-refundable deposit and food critic reviews and that their response was way too late - shouldve mentioned before i booked C. While I do trust Friend A's reasoning, I would double check google reviews for the restaurant to gauge how reliable/severe the food poisoning allegations are. D. Negotiate with Friend A to stick with the initial restaurant I would keep the booking due to the lateness of Friend A's response, the non refundable deposit and the counter-argument of great food critic reviews to the food poisoning allegations"
R_4Pk4ukh82fcM9bX,"A. disappointment and resentment, why did they not help to find a restaurant and just now decide to input their opinion? Especially when it is clearly not helpful anymore as its too late B. Where else should we go instead? I checked earlier and this one had good reviews C. Search it up, my friends information could be wrong, might as well double check D. I would check what my friend B likes to eat or just decide to go to the original restaurant I picked"
R_9hAOLp1N0EAyxFO,"I'd feel slightly annoyed that they only responded 3 hours before but also concerned as to why they'd stopped replying and only now decided that we should potentially cancel. I'd try to reassure my friend that there are only a few instances in which the food poisoning happened, and also let them know that I've paid a non-refundable deposit. I think that I would trust the information provided by food critics but would also validate my friend's concern regarding food poisoning. I'd double check if there are any other options available so we could potentially eat elsewhere, and if not keep the booking."
R_9dRnGUVSL6lM6hl,"When I saw Friend A’s message, honestly, I just felt a bit annoyed. We were supposed to plan this together one month ago, but he didn’t even reply to my texts. Now, only three hours before dinner, suddenly he sends me some screenshots about food poisoning at the place I booked. First thing I think is, “Why bring this up so late? I already paid the deposit and most places are probably booked out now.” I text Friend A back, “Why are you only saying this now? This place has a lot of good reviews, even food critics recommend it.”I don’t really trust random bad reviews online, because anybody can post them, maybe not even real customers. Most of the feedback for this restaurant is pretty good.But I still double-check. I search the restaurant’s name on Google again and look for any news about serious problems or health issues. If it’s just a few bad reviews and the experts say it’s good, I think it’s fine.So finally, I decide to keep the booking. Too late to change plans, and I don’t see real proof that it’s dangerous. It just feels more practical to stick with the original plan."
R_41ZtrfyfjJVGLwO,"The first emotion i feel is annoyed. I am not annoyed at that they found bad reviews on the restaurant I chose because that is a valid finding, however, I am annoyed that they responded late and do not have an alternative option reserved. In saying so, I would ask then first why they didn’t reply to me earlier. I want to understand their point of view and what they are going through before making any judgements about them. Then I would push us to both proceed us to find a new restaurant, but Iwnoukd ask them to pay half of the deposit that I set aside it is only fair."
R_9uK9OU4Zgkx3Pxv,"I'm immediately very frustrated and annoyed with friend A because they didn't help find the restaurant when they were supposed to and were rude enough to not respond to my messages, so they don't get to change the plans or have an opinion at this late stage. I'd say ""well, I've already paid the deposit and the reviews I've read are all glowing so we should still go, unless you'd be happy to reimburse me for the deposit"". Google reviews are anonymous so they're much less likely to be legit, while food critics are likely to be honest as they have a reputation to uphold to sustain their career. I would check all of the other google reviews before proceeding to see if any of them mention food poisoning. I would keep the booking as risk of food poisoning is low and probably was a one-off for that person who posted the google review, plus I don't want to lose my deposit money."
R_4K6A3cW1Y4DCpEZ,anger because why do you only care 3 hours before the booking when i had asked 1 month ago. agitated too. since i am non confrontational i would tell them to look for other options since i am currently busy and say that i missed those reviews when i was booking to mitigate any blame on me. I would say i am busy even if i wasnt because i already out the initial effort and they were unresponsive so it is there turn now. i would verify the google review. but also it could just be that one persons luck but to ensure i dont get blamed id be extra cautious. I would change my plans to avoid the possible drama of the other person saying i am negligent in my restaurant search.
R_45sFQ1KiRZd5vcZ,"My immediate gut reaction was mostly like an ""are you serious"" response. I definitely though of how is friend A and actual friend of B. I would defintely say to friend A that ""whats wrong with the restuarant? Just because one google reviever says that they got food poisoning, doesn't mean that the restaurant is bad. You didn't even respond to my texts, nor you didn't even help me out with finding a place ofr friend B"" I decided that the great reviews from food critics is more trustworhty than friend A, as they also only had one screenshot, versus many reviews from food critics. I would check the reviews of the restuarant again, and I would keep the booking as Friend A's argument is not valid to prove that we shouldn't go to that place. Furthermore, I want to be considerate fo Friend B as it is their birthday."
R_9EAyjcuzWwlSWsB,"I would feel very disappointed at the thought of having to cancel a nicely prepared dinner reservation for Friend B. I would tell Friend A that this restaurant has really good views and the food poisoning situations may not directly apply to this restaurant, as well as having paid for the reservation. I would ask Friend A what source she is receiving food poisoning information from in case it is just lies for bad reviews on certain restaurants. Further actions I could take would be to show her pictures of the restaurant's reviews and to find any reviews of food poisoning."
R_98LIgzqqTXmkhm0,"Initial reaction would be frustration and disbelief. They did not help with the process of deciding which restaurant to book nor did they help in paying the deposit. They only check 3 hours before the dinner starts to say we shouldn't go without even offering an alternative. I'd view them as impulsive, reckless and quick to judge. I'd respond that it's too late to change, that if they had a problem they should've said so sooner. I'd mention that i had already paid for the deposit and point out not all reviews talk about food poisoning and point out my own reviews for the restaurant. Regardless, i would listen to their worries about food poisoning and do some quick research on the reviews. What the customers who got food poisoning ordered so maybe we could avoid ordering the same. The frequency of food poisoning reviews and check reviews from other websites other than google to see if it's the same. That would help in the accuracy of the overall review of the restaurant, to see which is trustworthy. Overall, i would still stick with keeping the booking. I have paid for the deposit and i trust in my own research pointing the restaurant to be good. I am not someone who would cancel hours before."
R_4LUM6rz4IyYO7mN,"When Friend A suddenly texts me three hours before the dinner with screenshots of food poisoning reviews, my first reaction is frustration—why didn’t they help research earlier? I remind myself to stay calm and assess the situation. I compare the few negative Google reviews to the restaurant’s overall high ratings and professional critic endorsements, realizing isolated incidents don’t define the place. A quick check confirms most complaints are outdated or vague, while recent diners praise the food. Since canceling would mean losing the deposit and scrambling for a last-minute alternative, I decide to keep the booking. I’ll advise the group to avoid high-risk dishes and trust my initial research. If anything, Friend A owes me an explanation for disappearing—but for now, the birthday celebration goes on as planned."
R_4G3x7Ipdxkppf60,sometimes its bestto chekc if the restraunts website is legit as sometimes the websites themselevs can look shoddy look around and see the conditionis of the resteraunt and gauge if a normal person would find the atmosphere applealing. Check the reviws and see if the good reviws outweight the bad. If the bad reviews outweigh the good then it's safe to leave the restraunt as the good ffod critic reviews were probably fake and made by the resteraunt itself. ( Final plans leave: the risk of food poising is too big to risk on a friends birthday)
R_9QRrJIoDjaTtkjA,"1. should have told me your opinion earlier 2. reassure them that there were also great reviews 3. information straight from the sources, I consider the frequency of negative experiences, however if good reviews outweigh the bad significantly I stick to the good 4. should thoroughly check reviews and the other person's opinion prior to making the reservation"
R_4R8X3R31XZPpPUJ,"I would be extremely pissed and tell Friend A that maybe he should have said something earlier and actually contributed instead of commenting ONLY 3 hours before the dinner, either come or don't it's not my problem anymore. I would be disregarding his opinion and go anyway as I trust my research more and I would tell him off for being condescending and unhelpful. He did not put in any of the effort and only nudged for this near the actual deadline just three hours before the actual dinner, what say does he have compared to me, should have just kept his mouth shut. I would keep the booking plans."
R_9QD8SaZyhUCSZNv,I guess let Friend A choose and book a place if he thinks that place is bad. I would say that to him. C the chances of being poisoned is low. I would ask Friend B's opinion cuz its his bday
R_4xxzZCYZMQA1Fjg,"I think I'd tell them that if it has great review from critics then it'd probably be fine and people with bad experiences rant online more than people who have good experiences and i'd also say that there aren't any other places we could go to and we also already had a booking, and i'd think i take the information from the critics more so i would keep the booking because it's a confirmed booking rather then looking around and potentially not being able to get a booking"
R_9NVmMfCzK0yrrZn,"If the prerequisite is that he is my good friend, because my friends will directly tell me if they have any problems, so the reason why he no longer replies to my text messages is not just that. And I will believe his reminder about the restaurant issue, then I will immediately call the restaurant to confront and inquire about the specific situation and ask other friends who like to dine in various restaurants for their opinions about this restaurant, and then make a choice based on the situation. If I judge that it's okay, then I will continue to eat there and explain the restaurant's explanation to friend A. Or if the restaurant fails to convince me, I will choose to cook at home to celebrate my friend's birthday and either threaten to report them or ask for a refund of the deposit. If he is not the ""friend"" I consider him to be, then I will stop replying and not invite him to participate. The other procedures will remain the same as before."
R_9PAVCZ89IcvlfBk,"What a shit friend. Firstly, they didn't even bother to come up with an excuse for ignoring my messages and now they send this? Honestly they can just piss off since they didn't contribute anything to this plan. If they'd just responded like a decent person and helped me book a restaurant this issue would've been resolved much earlier. Nothing can justify ghosting me up until the day, especially since this was meant to be a team effort for Friend B's birthday. I'm texting back, 'maybe YOU shouldn't go because their is no 'we' in this plan,' then proceed to find the direct source of their screenshot. I did the research and none of them ever mentioned bad food practices or quality so I trust my own decision. I'm going to find if other sources have reported food poisoning because it'll most likely be on the news if a renowned restaurant, reviewed by many critics, gave their diners food poisoning. I'm going to keep the booking because it's a non-refundable deposit and I don't want to cancel plans last minute especially since it is a special occasion for someone else."
R_9nBlIRrmWhtjCPl,I would be extremely suspicious as the person agreed to the dinner in the first place and the fact that she is bailing would not make me happy. I would tell them that the place has great reviews and there is nothing to worry about. I would trust that the food is not poisoned as many other platforms would warn me about it but they didn’t. I would just go even if friend a wasn’t going because of the non refundable reservation.
R_4oIjFTLvhqtZ7UM,"What is wrong with Friend A? How are they not going to help at all then have something to complain about. My response would be ""Hey, so you actually ghosted me when I was looking for restaurants for Friend B. Since I've already paid a non-refundable deposit, unless you are willing to cover it, I think it would be best to just go. If you don't feel like coming, please don't."
R_9zvj7mgXc2CCZKn,"I would be resentful towards Friend A and argued for reasons they left me unread. I would say, ""Not my problem, already paid for it. You don't have to come if you have such low tolerance,"" to Friend A. I would prefer not to listen to what the critiques say and go try the restaurant myself. I would be more careful when ordering the food but still go with my preference and what others wanted too. I would rather confirm twice with Friend B because it was their birthday after all, and not me and Friend A. If Friend B was okay with the booking, then I see no issue to cancel the plan out, whatever. I would probably not going to talk with Friend A that night until later day. If Friend A recognise their fault, they should apologise and explain in detail what was going on with them."
R_4kppi5Tsg3rTVkZ,"I feel really angry, because A didn't respond my message when we had to find and choose a restaurant. I made all staffs by myself and paid the deposit, but A told me we shouldn't go 3 hours before the booking time. I will say to A: why don't you tell me this when I ask for your opinion? yes, I also think we shouldn't go after I read your message, but I already paid the deposit and it un-refundable. what do you think we should do now??? I decide trust A's information, because I don't want take we into a risks. I'll change plans, but I'll ask A to make a new plan and tell B what's happened."
R_4lLa3jvZvd4lVpy,"Should probably avoid restaurants with cases of food poisoning. Although, being a very good restaurant with good critic reviews, the chances of it happening again are low and the non-refundable deposit has already been paid. I would tell this to Friend A. The news source could also be untrustworthy. Keep booking for these reasons."
R_4dudAjdABDb7Msl,"Are they really sending this message now? They weren't trying to help me a month ago. I won't reply back with anything yet - I need time to think. I remember seeing that there were great reviews from food critics from this place. I should check when these negative Google reviews were made. I did pay a non-refundable deposit though, so unless I find out that the reviews were recent or a common experience, I will keep the booking."
R_4Oqsqm5fERNfAw0,"A. My initial reaction would me being a bit flustered at the response and feeling a bit mad at the sudden switch up in plans. I would also feel a bit angry as I was the one helping plan the outing a month ago, with friend B being unresponsive then and suddenly very responsive now about their opinions about the restaurant booking. B, I would text back in a calm but logical manner saying that their opinions are slightly last minute and that I have already paid a deposit for the booking. I would also tell them that the 'food poisoning' incident could have been a one off thing, or some random customers writing false reviews. C, I would trust the information of food critics, knowing the fact that they review restaurants as a career, and thus have creditable titles. D, Before we make a final decision, I would do a google search myself, about the reviews for the restaurant, and if the most recent reviews are rated on the higher side, I would text the friend and tell them this information. If it turned out that Friend A was right, where a bulk of the recent reviews for the restaurant were about food poisoning, then I would either just tank the deposit, or ask that friend to split the deposit (seeing that they were unresponsive about the celebrations a month ago, and that they still have some responsibility over the planning) - I would also do some quick searches for other restaurants. Overall, I would keep the booking, seeing that other nearby venues are full and it would be too last minute to change anything."
R_4erpfpI8p1ZfDah,id be annoyed at first and my first reaction would be disappointment and frustration. id remind friend A that they left me to book the dinner alone so its not really fair for them to have an opinion only three hours before the dinner. id tell them if they can find another restaurant and send me half the deposit i already paid then we can go elsewhere if they really want to. but id show them the great reviews from the food critics and stay confident with my choice of restaurant. ultimately i dont think there will be any other availability's in nearby restaurants so we will end up going to the one i initially chose.
R_9mZKOVSC49g5zX3,"My first instinct might have been something like, ""What? Are you serious? After I asked and got a silent response, and finally I had to make the decision all by myself after a month?"" I might have felt frustrated and doubtful. I might have said to A, but now there are only three hours left. If we need to look for a new restaurant now, we might not be able to find a suitable one. And did many people say that in your comment? Or was it just an exception? If it was an exception, it might be caused by reasons such as competitors or guests having poor digestion, etc. Or we could also check on the local health bureau government platform to see if there are any public information about this restaurant. This should be relatively authoritative information. And I heard that the food critics of this restaurant have very high ratings. If we can't confirm that we can't find a suitable restaurant, perhaps we could also try this restaurant. Finally, because of these official information, multiple comments from various sources, the costs we have already paid and that are irrecoverable, I decided to keep the reservation."
R_4Dvwp2rXBfPgWnp,"I would feel frustrated and angry at my friend. This is because I would most likely recall how my friend did not respond and if they had helped earlier this would most likely not happen. I would also be feeling that way just about how this is happening so last minute. I would then message my friend complaining about how they did not respond and if they had helped this would not have happened. Then I would tell them about how there is good food reviews from critics but, and that I will check about how many food poisoning reviews are there, and wether they are over a long period of time or close to each other as if there reviews are over a long period of time then its better to look at other places, and also if there is more than 4 food poison reviews its again best to not go but if its less than 4 and over a spam of long period of time then we should just go as its very unlikely for anything to happen. I would still base our decisions on reviews as I feel like they are more trust worthy than food critics. After seeing the reviews, based on what I said, I would make a decision."
R_944ny0AxPq31Zip,"A. Very annoyed and upset. I can't believe they finally decided to speak up at a point where nothing can be done to fix it. I'd feel as though they thought their judgement was better than mine and I'd be slightly panicked as well because of the lack of time to find a place everyone would enjoy. B. I'd probably let their response sit for a while after I'd seen it as a way to channel my anger about their lack of response. Then I would text back something along the lines of ""If you can find a better restaurant to go to, I'm down otherwise we are going to x restaurant in 3 hours"". I'd also attatch screenshots of the critic reviews I saw. C. I would look at overall ratings and also the extreme 5 star and 1 star reviews to see if anything seemed off about them. I'd also check multiple websites and potentially Tiktoks. D. I'd consider what the birthday person likes and if their preferences are closer to mine or friend A's before I make my final decision. I would keep the booking as there doesn't seem to be enough time to make new plans that would be equally well organised. I would perhaps suggest friend A to choose a dessert place in case the restaurant was bad to make sure the night ends well and both of us had input in the planning."
R_4bQ7vkzPuystEuH,"When I received that last-minute message from friend A—just three hours before dinner—I was shocked and frustrated. A month ago, when I asked for help to book a restaurant for friend B’s birthday, they completely ignored my texts. So I made the reservation myself, even paid a non-refundable deposit. Now, suddenly, they show up with a screenshot of a negative Google review claiming someone got food poisoning? At first, I panicked. But then I reminded myself why I chose this restaurant in the first place. It had amazing reviews from trusted food critics, a high rating overall, and a strong reputation. I decided to investigate further before reacting. I called the restaurant to ask if they had received any recent complaints—they hadn’t. I also looked up the restaurant’s health inspection record and found no issues. After weighing the facts, I decided to stick with my original plan. One anonymous review wasn’t enough to change everything last minute. I’ll monitor the situation closely, but I’m confident in the choice I made."
R_4EFJc6lUEDNDi9w,"I would propably still go to the restaurant. I may confuse about why A know I book this restaurant and why stop responding my text before but now giving me feedback, is there anything wrong with A and B? Then, I would check the Googld review and other social media to verify the ""food poisoning"". I would thank A for the reminder and ask her why she didn't reply to my message. And I will judge my previous doubts based on A's response. I would consiser although there is food poisoning, it a matter of probability -- bad experiences can happen occasionally. Since this place has strong review from food critics, the deposit cannot be refund and most other retaurants are already fully booked, I think it is still worth going."
R_9wubrUCWKLR4c2Y,"my immediate reaction since that friend A is not a very reliable friend. To not help at all with planning and then suddenly having a problem on the day of is inappropriate. I would say to friend A that when selecting the restaurant I saw various great food reviews from critics, and I've also paid a non-refundable deposit so we will have to stick with the restaurant. I trust that all information is trustworthy but there's not much to do to change the matter now. If friend A is really worried they can call the restaurant and ask about these negative reviews or avoid the foods that these included. I would keep the booking, as I want to keep my money and partly also as the friend didn't offer at all to help organise so they don't get a say, particularly the day of"
R_9THr3sTh9orw2vF,A. immediate annoyance would get me. B. That they did not even help with the process of the booking so they do not have the right to complain about possible food poisoning incidents. C. I would decide based on the majority of what the reviews tell me and deduct that friend a is being over dramatic about the situation all in all. D. I would keep the booking and might uninvite friend a.
R_4eKgzneBgOcLEid,"I will immediately click to read the comments about poisoning, but I will still feel quite angry. If the person who does not care about anything just enjoys himself, I will not care. If the poisoning is serious, then I probably won't go, but the money for booking the restaurant needs to be paid by me."
R_9bLnX1BQG4bDWWB,"Immediately, my gut reaction, and honestly anyone's initial reaction would be despair. To have been given a whole month to complete such an otherwise simple task, only to not fulfil it, would be incredily disappointing. Shamful even. The first thing I would say to friend A is to sit them right down and investigate why they had left you hanging for weeks on end. Though it mightn't be the best use of time, I feel that it would at least dispel some of the built up tension. After we've discussed the elephant in the room, we would then figure out whose sources are more trustworthy, by simply considering the reliability of our food critics, and their google reviews. Hopefully, there should be enough of a sample size for one of the two to deduce an objective answer. If the worst case scenario transpires i.e. food poisoning seems to run rampant, we'd have to give one last ditch attempt at finding another restaurant. I personally do not think calling off the event would be viable, depending on the number of attendees, as it would be very abrupt for the most trivial of reasons. If no restaurant is available, we might just have to go through with the current one and hope for the best, giving a large disclaimer to all attendees that they might risk getting sick idk"
R_4urgxvgc132zoCi,I would be quite annoyed at friend A and would tell them they should've responded earlier or said something before I had booked the restaurant. I would still go to the restaurant though because it'd already been paid for and just kept the food poisoning information in mind (maybe chosen something that didn't have to be cooked). I'd leave the booking all to friend A the next time unless they specifically asked for my help with it all.
R_9kHvimlWxabzpn3,"I would feel annoyed at Friend A for bringing this up so late after not contributing to the planning and leaving the job to me. I would say to Friend A that I had to pay a non-refundable deposit and other restaurants are all booked out so we should probably go to the restaurant anyways. But i would also ask if they had any other restaurants they could find and book. I would look at the reviews to see if there are any more people who got food poisoning but i would probably insist it was a rare happening and ignore it to go to the restaurant instead. Ultimately, i would keep the booking because I paid the deposit and other venues are mostly full."
R_9zSm0Rtpydxh50L,"I would feel annoyed as I was ghosted until last minute, where Friend A didn't even contribute to picking and now he is complaining about the place I picked. I would tell Friend A, maybe if he / she helped me earlier, we would have found a better restaurant. I would also call up the restaurant and ensure they have certificates that show how safe their food is, and ask nearby friends if they have had the restaurant and get opinion. I would also if I really cannot find any alternatives, ask Friend B if that restaurant would be suitable for his birthday. I believe if most my friends say it's a good restaurant and they have certificates that ensure they are up to high quality, I would keep the booking."
R_9ewvQqcISGg20dM,"a. I feel speechless because he didn’t reply to my messages before, but once I made the decision, he suddenly came to question the option I chose. Why didn’t he say anything earlier? b. Oh, really? But a lot of restaurants are already full now. It’ll be troublesome to look for another one at this point. c. Food poisoning sounds more believable. d. Check the negative reviews f. change plans, because negative reviews are more believable."
R_9kTCAUflKkIxCMx,"My immediate reaction is to just continue to the restaurant as the situation says that i havent found anything negative myself and that the friend hasnt been responding which indicates that they are not that close to me. I'd double check online to see if i can find anything negaitve about it and if not I'd just continue. This might be different if the friend is a really close when which if that was the case, I may consider cancellation but otherwise it makes most sense to just go as it is non refundable and in this specific situation, I myself have not found anything supporting his claims."
R_4hz1oupZI1VLOKO,"a. My immediate emotional reaction is of annoyance, since Friend A didn't bother to even help me pick the restaurant, let me send a deposit, and *then* sent me the Google reviews. If Friend A was too busy, that's one thing, but there was no communication. b. I'd say ""I appreciate the warning but I really think you should have helped me with this earlier. I wasn't aware of the reviews and now I have a non-refundable deposit, a money hole. Please help me find another place, although it's such short notice."" c. I'd trust the negative reviews more. Food critics would be more likely to receive good food, since they were specifically writing reviews on it, and regular customers would be a better metric for the overall quality of the restaurant. d. I'd tell Friend A that we should split for a different restaurant (change plans), and then find another one in the area for Friend B."
R_40TVJRQSynAT7Gu,"A. Immediately after Friend A brings this to my attention, I would feel very irritated and upset by them. B. I would tell them that I had already made the reservation a month in advance, which they were aware of. Knowing this, they could have informed me of the bad Google Reviews earlier, instead of telling me on the day when it was too late. I would also say that I gave them the opportunity to help me find a restaurant and provide their input, but they chose to ignore my messages. So it wouldn't be fair for Friend A to suggest that we shouldn't go 3 hours prior to the booking, when they deliberately chose to stop responding to my texts during the initial stages of planning. I would also voice that they're not respecting my time since they decided to inform me of the poor ratings on the day of the event, leaving me with little to no options on what to do. C. Although I have a high amount of respect for food critics, I would regard the numerous accounts of food poisoning from other customers more. I think this ties in with my own personal experiences with food poisoning from restaurants before, so I would like to try my best to avoid it from happening again. D. Before making a decision on what to do next, I would consult the other guests, but most importantly, Friend B. I would value their decision the most since it's their birthday. Overall, I would choose to change plans despite how annoyed I would be, especially considering the non-refundable booking. However, I would rather lose that money than take chances at everyone getting food poisoning and ruining the celebration even more."
R_97CH322YiXUy0cp,"My initial reaction is a mix of annoyance and frustration towards Friend A for bringing up potential food poisoning at such short notice. I feel like they may be trying to cause unnecessary drama or sabotage the plans. I would likely reply to Friend A expressing my surprise at their sudden concern and questioning why they didn't mention this earlier during our planning. When deciding which information to trust, I would weigh the credibility of professional critics' reviews against random Google reviews mentioning food poisoning incidents. I would also consider the overall positive reputation of the restaurant. Before making a final decision, I would quickly search for more recent reviews or news articles about the restaurant to check if there have been any recent food safety issues. Ultimately, I would stick with the original booking at the restaurant. The positive professional reviews and my past positive experiences there outweigh the last-minute concerns raised by Friend A. I would also keep an eye on everyone's well-being during and after the dinner."
R_9ADm21vJo7nh1VT,"I would feel annoyed as my plans are being disrupted in this way, especially after friend A stopped responding. I would encourage them to still go through with the booking despite the reviews. Although I would trust the food poisoning information more, as both are online reviews but one is negative meaning there is a higher change of negative impact, I have already made a non-refundable deposit. I would be careful of any food I order and avoid risky food. I would encourage everyone to go still."
R_4iOlrUy7IyRo5DX,"I would firstly be quite mad, hopefully understandably. The fact he now wants to provide his opinion after Ive paid a deposit has got me angry. I'd want to confront him and say something along the lines of ""Oh so now you want to do some research a few hours beforehand when you had a whole month to show me this. Don't start now because you had stopped responding to my texts what else was i supposed to do?"" Despite my anger, I'd find him the reviews that I'd read and we'd compare. I'd come up with an ultimatum, because at the end of the day If we end up having a terrible experience it will be on me. I'd propose we don't go, find somewhere else, but he'd have to pay me half the deposit. I would still be angry, but ultimately this event is for Friend B, and tension between Friend A and I would lead to a bad birthday for him."
R_4aUK0rI5Q5xMv99,"A. Anger and frustration towards the friend. Not only that they left when it was time to actually help and make a deposit but also that they are looking at negative reviews to be contrarian. B. I am not as confrontational as I should be but I would definitely go ahead with the booking and brush him/her off. C. I wouldn't deny that some people got food poisoning but if it is a popular restaurant with thousands dining a week and there was an occasion or 2 where people got food poisoning, it wouldn't bother me. D. Nope. The deposit has been paid so we will go ahead with it. We would keep the booking because the deposit has been paid, if the friend didn't leave before then he could have helped make the decision but they did leave therefore it is not up to them at this point."
R_9lztR3uL6egBey2,"Firstly, as it is a serious and important thing which I expect my friend to act with. If they ignore my texts, it would make me mad and disappointed, but I would say regardless that he or she was being lazy or ignorant in this matter if it turned uglier. How I would decide if the information is trustworthy is I would ask others, or see well known reviews about the place. As Friend A was late in response his or her opinion would not matter to me. I would keep the booking regardless."
R_4Eheu30i18UxWo5,"I've made a mistake about choosing the restaurant but it is solvable - maybe - we can always pick another restaurant. Yes there was a non refundable deposit but as long as thee is no cancelation/late fee then we can just go somewhere else. If there is a cancelation/late fee then may be we can just go there for a couple of drinks. To Friend A, you should've communicated to me straight away if you wanted to be apart of the planning. You can't just ghost someone as you start planning for someone's BIRTHDAY, like you need to communicate if you want a say. I would check the google reviews and see how current the negative ones are/check the most current reviews. Just because a place is 4-5 star doesn't mean that currently they deserve that rating, and the most current reviews will explain the current conditions. Final choice would be research, and then if the reviews are correct; take it as a fail and just pick another place because at the end of the day you don't want anyone sick on their birthday."
R_97VvwanVzOGTy6T,"You did not decide to initially help when planning for friend B's birthday and instead ghosted my texts. Your input is late and would have been much appreciated when I first asked for your opinions as well as any other thoughts or concerns you had. I have done some research and looked through a couple restaurants, according to food critics (which in my opinion are more reliable sources than the average customer) the restaurant is rated highly. Despite this, if we still wanted to book another restaurant, it would be too last minute as other nearby venues are full so we are much better off sticking with the restaurant that was originally agreed on. I can try to find other restaurants however I don't think we will find one to accommodate our party so last minute, this is exactly why planning prior is important. I will be keeping the booking due to these reasons."
R_9UflZdQoAT9DJQ4,"I would feel disappointed, but I would take action and start looking at restaurants, making a booking for us. I'd then let the whole group know that I made an appointment, but also text Friend A individually to let them know that they didn't need to spend time anymore searching. I'd look for a cuisine that the birthday person enjoyed, and address any allergies within the group. I would change the plans since I am nervous about the previous reviews involving food poisoning and would choose to make new plans over the risk of getting food poisoning."
R_4TPMkluCQ2DzeWR,"i'd be annoyed and frustrated. why would you disagree the day of? why didn't you book somewhere you thought was better? why is it up to me to do? if you want to change the booking you need to find a better alternative, otherwise we're staying with this one. especially if i had paid non-refundable deposit, i wouldn't let the plans to be changed unless compensated. ask friend a why they only just said something. tell friend a that I've seen good reviews. I honestly at that point wouldn't care, i'd still go and just be cautious when im there. keep the booking"
R_4jDrMj7MSEYhv6g,"My immediate reaction was anger, and I asked friend A why she didn't mention the negative news about the restaurant before I asked for help or made a reservation. However, if this restaurant has ever caused a food poisoning incident, I must also take it seriously. I'll check to see if the negative review is from a long time ago and to see if there are other restaurants nearby that still have space. I also call restaurants directly to ask if they've had any recent customer complaints about their food, and look at recent trends in the review section to see if the negative review is an isolated phenomenon or repeated. In my opinion, if the comment about food poisoning is an exception, and the restaurant is highly praised by the gourmets, I will not easily change the restaurant temporarily, which is not only unfair, but also the non-refund of the reservation fee will cause me a loss."
R_9qkbBEEu4LBm4Vh,"As soon as I saw Friend A’s message about the food poisoning reviews, my heart dropped a little. I was annoyed, honestly, not just because of the message, but because they didn’t help at all with the booking in the first place. Now, three hours before dinner, they suddenly raise concerns? I felt frustrated and stressed, especially since I’d already paid a non-refundable deposit. I’d probably text Friend A back with something like, “Hey, that’s concerning — but where was this energy a month ago when I asked for help booking? We’re kind of out of options now.” That may sound harsh, but it’s the truth, and we need to be practical. To figure out if the food poisoning claims are valid, I’d check the date and frequency of those negative reviews. Are they recent and consistent? Or just a one-off? I’d also check reliable food blogs or critic reviews again, especially since this place had great feedback from professionals. If possible, I’d call the restaurant to ask if they’re aware of any recent incidents. Given how last-minute this is, and the fact that most nearby places are full, I’d lean toward keeping the booking unless I find solid evidence that the issue is ongoing. It’s not ideal, but cancelling now with no backup would ruin Friend B’s birthday more than a small risk might. So, unless I uncover something serious, I’d stick with the original plan and go, but maybe avoid any raw seafood just in case."
R_9LcntUWi1nBzmM6,"A. I'd be irritated, conscious as to whether they said that because they disliked me, were tired, or genuinely concerned about going to the restaurant. B. I would reassure them about the reviews and confirm they were sure about not going, assuring them it would be fine if not. C. Depends how long I have known that person for firstly, then I would choose if the reason was valid, in this case I would find it wasn't, then ask for clarification on there reasoning to get more insight into whether they were speaking the truth. D. Again would confirm with them their decision and ask if they would still want to go out that night, reassuring it would be ok if not. I would change plans if they were uncomfortable or unsure, otherwise I would reassure them about the food and keep the booking."
R_49uZMYwK4FPR2Jv,"I would feel very frustrated as to have last minute change, especially if they had not given a helping hand prior to making the decision. I'd respond to their text message, letting them know that if they want to change the booking, they are free to but I personally would like to continue on with the plan as it is hard to find a different restaurant so quickly. I would take into consideration the reviews about food poisoning and suggest that we simply avoid ordering specific dishes. The final decision would be for me to keep the reservation or ask Friend B for their opinion on the matter. If they are indifferent, it would be up to Friend A to cancel the booking and find a new restaurant themselves. Otherwise, the reservation will stay and proceed."
R_4s5dRRD2FdMG1BY,"A: Who does Friend A think she is, I bowed the dinner all on my own and she is trying to undermine my plan. Does she really think I wouldn’t look at reviews before booking the place. B: It would be dependable o my relationship with Friend B, but f she as a close friend,I would sincerely tell her that we’re going here if you like it or not C: I’ll will consolidate my information an double check the reviews,,,if the review seem to be trust worthy, I’ll go with my own information. However, if the informations untrustworthy worthy, I’ll take friend B information into consideration D: ‘lol call the restaurant and consolidate all the information I need"
R_9qYtBzsH2T1JLt7,"i felt very gutted when the friend sent the negative reviews of the restaurant, and there is some doubt in my mind about the legitimacy of those reviews, as I remember the restaurant having some positive reviews in regards to its atmosphere and the food there. I would ask friend a where they got and sourced the information from, as it would be highly unlikely they got the information from a reputable source if i have already read the reviews and they were all, if not, mostly positive about the restaurant. I would consider where i got the info from, as well as my friend, and i will use that information to decide which info is trustworthy and which ones aren’t. I’ wont take any actions before choosing I would change plans"
R_42MC2sq8D1AMHgC,"A. First I am a bit annoyed at the lack of his communication with me to his opposition to my idea that he had no contirbutino to. Iwonder why he stopped responding. B. I would encourage Friend A to stick to the plan, that food poisoning is not that huge of a deal (for me at lesat so it would be calm) C. Check if the said reviews are recent, but food poisoning can also happen in any place D. Do thing. My final choice is to stick to the plan becuase I have already made a non-refundable deposit, the birthday friend already knows where it is, and it will be highest convenience."
R_9H2EgGSHs88CCFX,"a) immediate gut reaction is upset, disappointed and nervous b) i would say that its up to them to show up or not but they must pay me back for the deposit if they don't show and that i'm upset with the lack of communication we had c) i would have checked the review for myself to actually see if it was credible or an excuse my friend had made, d) see if there is anything like that restaurant as an alternative final choice would have been to stick to the restaurant and not change plans"
R_9ckoGSppiMihfQB,oh my days nah were going critics critics again we goin
R_9gKWvGKZjF95Y4x,"My immediate emotional reaction would be that my friend needs to consider the lengths I went to; e.g booking the restaurant and paying the non-refundable fee. I would kindly reply reassuring her that the restaurant has good reviews, and maybe send a screenshot of the majority reviews that show this. I would then say that I don’t mind going elsewhere if they really are persistent on it. We would probably discuss back and forth our options, reviewing the restaurant together form multiple sources and forming our opinion. We would keep the plans, unless really heated argument arises and its non-negotiation from my friend."
R_4DIOFgBmrAWKKl6,"My immediate reaction would be anger or annoyance as Friend A did not seem interested in helping. I would tell them about the critics reviews and say its worth giving it a go as its so last minute. I believe the information from critics is trustworthy as they do it as a job. I would look further into reliable sources about the validity of the food poisoning claims. I would keep the booking and ensure that the foood seems okay to eat, unless a more reliable solution was presented."
R_47njEZ9mGdQQAmJ,"friend a needs to fuck off, if they didn't want to go to that fucking restaurant then they should've been involved from the start instead of fucking ghosting me and making me choose the place, not only that but the place is fucking non-refundable, i don't gaf if they don't want to go, imma fucking go regardless. I'd probably text them something semi passive aggressive like: Hey! I didn't realise that you had such a concern from food poisoning, however, it is possible to get food poisoning at any restaurant and we don't know if they got food poisoning from that restaurant or from something else they'd eaten that day. Furthermore, they have amazing reviews from food critics and it's a type of food I believe our friend would like. If you had concerns about this dinner place then you should have shared them when we were meant to be planning where to go. Not three hours before when it would be impossible to get another booking at a place i know our friend would enjoy, and after I've paid a non-refundable booking fee. If it so deeply concerns you then you can reimburse me the booking fee and book another place but I truly don't think its much of a concern. Keep the booking: disrespectful to change that last minute, non-refundable fee, should've been involved from the beginning, unlikely to get a booking at another place, they should fuck right off."
R_4WIL6fzUqy0uy2G,"I would be pretty pissed, although I would have very likely to avoid non-refundable deposit for booking to beginning (I didn't know that this was a thing even). I would first text friend A asking why they would tell me such thing at the very last minute instead of helping, possibly some mild rage baiting and guilt tripping them. I most likely won't be able to decide whenever the information is trustworthy, as it's the internet and worse it's Google Reviews, literally anybody can write on there. I would most likely change plans to a less expensive restaurant (if this one was expensive) but maybe somewhere that I know is good and possible delay the birthday for a day or so. I would confirm it with friend B. In the case where they are busy or don't like the delay, I would change plans to maybe another area to celebrate the birthday."
R_4SiwDEt39qYpx6u,"A) Wondering why Friend A is only responding now; Considering what I know about Friend A and their situation, take a few moments to come up with possible reasons. B) ""What's been going on, you didn't respond to any of my messages since last month. Are you okay?"" C&D) I would go and check those google reviews myself, see how reliable they seem (i.e. whether they seem like spam or bots, or whether they're actually nuanced, thoughtful reviews); compare the dates of those google reviews and the critic reviews. * It seems like important information to take into consideration, so I would appreciate receiving it even if the timing is bad. Unless there's enough good evidence that the restaurant is bad quality, I'd likely keep the booking plan. I would also take the deposit price into consideration, as well as whether or not we know any other good available restaurants. I would perhaps be more careful about what we order if there are specific dishes that were reported to give food poisoning."
R_9DqIf4wJEjv36cP,"I would firstly be surprised that the the restaurant would have such poor experiences, especially upon remembering the high acclimations from critics. I would tell Friend A that its probably just once off situations, and that we should try it ourselves considering our limited options. I would choose to keep our booking and go to the restaurant. In addition, other restaurants would probably be fully booked or have no space for us on such short notice, so unless there was another option for eating then the initial restaurant is our only option. I would also maybe conduct my own research on the reviews, in ortder to verify legitimacy"
R_9dugL9haczQVFjn,What is she on about? and be confused Then I msg saying I checked all the reviews its fine plus we literally can't go anywhere else I trust the online reviews that I have read as the friend hasn't put any effort in to even try to help I would keep the booking and tell the friend to be ready and at the restaurant by the booking time
R_9h5u12dwC5eG2Z6,"The moment I read Friend A’s message, my first reaction is frustration. They ignored my texts a month ago when I asked for help with booking, and now—three hours before the dinner—they suddenly want to question the choice? That feels both inconsiderate and unhelpful. I want to tell them, “You could have raised this much earlier,” but I also know getting into an argument right now will not solve the problem. I remind myself that I chose this restaurant after reading several positive professional reviews from trusted food critics. One or two bad Google Reviews do not necessarily mean the place is unsafe; sometimes online reviews are exaggerated or even fake. Still, food safety is important, so I would quickly check recent official health inspection reports online and scan multiple review platforms to see if there’s a genuine pattern of complaints. Given the time constraints, the fact that I’ve paid a non-refundable deposit, and that the majority of sources praise the restaurant’s quality, I decide to keep the booking. I believe the information I originally trusted remains more reliable than a couple of negative online comments, especially on such short notice."
R_9GDETN8lfI96G4x,"Why did you disappear when we were supposed to work on this together? And now, after I handled everything on my own, you suddenly show up—just to criticize my choice? Honestly, I’m frustrated. I spent time researching, made the reservation, and even paid a non-refundable deposit. Now, with just three hours to go, you send me screenshots about food poisoning? Of course, no restaurant wants something like that to happen—it must’ve been an isolated case. The critics loved this place. And let’s be real: it’s Friday evening, most places are already full. What exactly do you expect me to do now? Cancel everything based on a few bad reviews, risk losing the deposit, and scramble to find a new spot last-minute? It feels like you’re not even considering how much effort I’ve put in. At this point, I’m leaning toward keeping the booking. Unless something really urgent comes up, we’re going."
R_9PvWDImxOitPjFi,I immediately feel anxious and then guilty for not checking for reviews thoroughly. I would then be annoyed about the disappearance of Friend A. I would tell them that I had already made the booking and that it was nonrefundable. If there is no availbility elsewhere I would keep the booking.
R_4lSNZLsjvNgORxZ,"It might be a little late too change now, maybe if you spoke up earlier it would have been helpful. I have checked many reviews and they say that this restraunt is good and trustworthy. Lets just stick too it."
R_4s0LyD7vCcmzXcA,"When I read the message of Friend A, I felt depressed because no one helped to complete the plan before the birthday, and no one returned any messages to me. Near the beginning of the activity, they showed up and disrupted my plan. I might ask Friend A: Why didn't you reply to my messages before and agree to these decisions? Because I have been disappointed with them. I will check the user name and comment release date to confirm the authenticity of these messages."
R_4Yh9KMaB7T35VHH,"well why didn't they tell me right away? they just stopped responding and we had a month to decide this. i'd be quite upset. what's A's reason for doing that?? do they not actually want to go, do they want to pin it all on me so they can blame me if something's wrong? are they trying to ruin B's special day? id say ""why are you telling me this now?? we can't go anywhere else and my research showed its a good place. im sorry man but unless you can find somewhere else or come up with an alternative somehow then we're going there. you dont have to come if you dont want to lol"" i'd also check the google review accounts to see if they were recently created, their history etc. wow im a little paranoid. basically if i found that they were created only for this i would just go with B and ignore what A said, if they come they can come but i'll talk to them privately afterward and tell B about it sometime"
R_4PRyBwd0Rj1hXAv,Friend A doesn't have the right to suddenly decide that they want to change the resturant when they did not take the responsibility to choose it with me like we had planned. I'd tell Friend A that it is too late to change resturants and they they should of helped me in the beginning if they had a preference. Since the restaurants has had consistently good reviews and the one my friend showed me was a minority I would still consider going and keep the booking. However before that I would check that the food critic reviews are still there.
R_4oYj8hpyfzkL4qd,"I would immediately be quite annoyed, I'd tell Friend A that I had already booked and made a non refundable deposit. I'd show them the food reviews from critics. I'd then convince them to continue with the restruant that I had booked"
R_9ysX3HF7qQg4tjz,"Ugh, are you kidding me? Friend A is texting now? After ghosting me for a month when I needed help booking? My first thought is pure frustration—where were they when I was scrambling to find a place, putting down my own money for the deposit? Now, three hours before dinner, they’re suddenly an expert with Google Reviews? I should do a quick check: maybe look up the restaurant’s health inspection score online. Most places post that, and it’s a solid indicator. Also, text Friend B—maybe they’ve heard anything about the spot? But I don’t want to panic them. And, nearby venues are full. If we cancel, we might end up with no place for B’s birthday. The deposit is non-refundable, so that’s money down the drain. I’ll keep the booking. The critics’ reviews are more trustworthy, the timing is too tight to change, and Friend A’s sudden concern feels unearned. I’ll mention the health check to ease any worries, but we’re going."
R_4EGgUEbaGhlE4RE,"I would be annoyed and irritated that Friend A would have the audacity to complain about my choice of restaurant when s/he did not help at all. I would then also feel like friend a is undermining my ability and to think that I would reserve a restaurant without looking at reviews would slightly offend me. It would have been better had it been not three hours before the dinner, and if that friend had checked other platforms other than just google. I would say to Friend A that I chose that restaurant based on food critiques and could not get her feedback since she did not respond to my text. I would ask her to at least try it out considering how difficult it is to book other restaurants right now. I would not show irritatedness since it would start the night on the wrong foot. I would accept the information from google review but will keep in mind of food critiques as well. I would think that the food critiques may be biased if they are promoted, and owning up to that. I would end up doing further research and if its all accurate and consistent then I would proceed with compromising with friend a and reassuring her to go to the planned restaurant."
R_9cSz6xO81NhYah9,"that is so annoying if they had helped me plan and find a restaurant in the first place we wouldnt have to second guess the place. its gonna be impossible to find a restaurant in 3 hours and the google reviews only had CLAIMS regarding food poisoning, no one could have confirmed that they got it from there so we can risk it. im the one who paid the deposit so to her it doesnt matter because she didnt even help plan it whatever. id tell her that its too late now and we dont have any other options, lets just go and order things that would be lessl ikely to give us food poisoning. i do a final search on google, yelp, critics, and tiktok about the restaurant before confirming. but ultimately i think we will settle for this restaurant as we are 3 hours out and have no other possible options."
R_4mWWreCcbAYAgcr,"a) annoyance b) i would say sorry i paid a non refundable deposit so we cant really change up, ask them to look into places for dessert that we could go afterwards and what food people were getting sick from to be safe we could avoid that on the menu. c) i would trust my initial information, critics are professionals i would trust them over a hand few reviews from customers who very likely could be sick from something else they ate or other unrelated reaons. d) check what food was making people sick and not order it, look into other reviews from those people to see if they frequently leave poor reviews. my final choice is same as my answer to b"
R_9pZ4VmJn5WPju4M,"When I first saw Friend A’s message, my heart sank. After all the effort I put in to find and secure the booking—especially when they ghosted me during the planning—this was the last thing I needed. My gut reaction was frustration, but also concern, because food poisoning is serious. I’d reply to Friend A immediately: “That’s worrying—where did you find this review, and how recent is it?” Before making a decision, I’d check the credibility of the reviews. Were they from verified diners? Were there multiple recent reports, or just an isolated case from months ago? I’d also cross-reference other review platforms and the restaurant’s official social media to see if they’ve addressed any complaints. If possible, I’d call the restaurant directly to ask about the alleged incident. Given the short notice and the restaurant’s strong critic reviews, if I found the complaints were old or unverified, I’d keep the booking. But if the issue seemed current and genuine, I’d cancel—even if it meant losing the deposit—and quickly search for a backup venue, because everyone’s health is more important than money."
R_97APSd1kYg20UmZ,"A). I would feel a bit annoyed initially due to the lack of communication from friend A and last minute intervention. B). I would ask friend A if they have any alternatives in mind and if they would be willing to share the deposit fees in the case of cancelling of reservation. C). The source of the information is important. Restaurant critics, health inspectors and other governing bodies are more reliable sources than one off incidences of food poisoning. D). I would ensure there is a replacement available. Additionally, I would make sure that friend A is on board this time. As a final choice I would most likely stick with the booking. This is due to the high praise the restaurant has from critics and also the deposit that has already been put down. The few complaints towards the restaurant are common for any establishment and with the support the restaurant has it counters that."
R_4hpIVUPRHVc2sCt,"My immediate gut/emotional response would be kinda annoyed - I would have already been a little annoyed because we were both meant to getting this ready for friend B's birthday and they stopped responding, but then to say ""hey we shouldn't go"" after I chose a place and made a deposit I would be quite annoyed. I would probably not reply right away, I would look at the reviews and see how long ago they were, and how many of the reviews talk about food poisoning in comparison to total reviews. If the reviews were quite old/if they were only a very few of total reviews, I would reply with these findings, and push that I believe it will be okay. If these reviews are many and recent, I would reply something like ""well what do you think we should do?"" and put the burden of working things out on their shoulders."
R_9fA6B5uPjcqDdWF,"A. Annoyed B. I would try to confront Friend A, but I would try to make it civil. C. Check if the reviews really say that there is food poisoning or not. D. I'd probably ask friend A if they had a problem with friend B or with the restaurant's pricing. I would try to recommend other restaurants if they didn't like the place/food/pricing, because we're trying to make a good birthday for friend B. D. Calming myself down to have a civil conversation with friend A. I'd try to rationalise and talk it out with friend A first before keeping the booking or changing plans, according to their decision."
