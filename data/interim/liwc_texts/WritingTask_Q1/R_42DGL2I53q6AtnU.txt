I would feel frustrated at friend A as they had neglected to help me find the restaurant, leading me to not only do all the work in finding a restaurant, but also in paying the deposit. I would immediately tell friend A that I had paid a non-refundable deposit, and highlight how many established food critics had left high reviews. Following this, I would check the google reviews of the restaurant again (although might I add, I most likely probably already checked the reviews before booking, since I had seen reviews from food critics). If the reviews had a high volume of recent food poisoning reviews, then I would feel obliged to cancel, but would ask friend A to pay me half of the deposit, as we were meant to book this restaurant together anyways. If there was one or two food poisoning reviews, or if many of these alleged food poisoning reviews were not recent, I would make the decision to continue as A) food critics are often much more trustworthy than google reviews, unless there are multiple google reviews saying the same thing; B) most nearby venues are full and finding a new reservation would be a pain; C) I paid a non-refundable deposit that I would very much not like to lose and D) friend A ghosted me, and only texts me back now? If they had concerns maybe they should've played a more active role in finding a restaurant rather than offloading on me at the last minute.
