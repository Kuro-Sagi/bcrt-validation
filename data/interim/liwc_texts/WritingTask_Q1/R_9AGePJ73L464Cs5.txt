immediately, i would be extremely pissed off. i hate incompetence and lack of communication, so the fact that they let me know their thoughts so late would anger me. my response would depend on the past experiences i’ve had with this friend. if it’s a friend that has done similar things to this in the past, i would express these thoughts to my friend but not with as much anger but definitely with my feelings. i would tell them that they should’ve spoken to me sooner and collaborated with me more when choosing the restaurant. whereas if it was a friend that would usually not do something like this and is an overall organised person, i would be willing to listen to them (still a bit angry tho). i think i would still stick my foot down and wont change the restaurant. if they were really stubborn or insistent for some reason, id demand for some sort of financial compensation, probably them paying 50% for the payment i had to spend for the booking. overall, i’m not changing the plans because i’m not willing to listen to an irresponsible individual who didn’t bother to communicate with me until this point. also because there’s money involved.
