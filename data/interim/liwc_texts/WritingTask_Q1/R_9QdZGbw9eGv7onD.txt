I would be extremely pissed off as I tried to communicate with them, but if they're not responding to the texts is generally annoying. It is their fault for not checking the messages so I would say we should be fine and still go to the restaurant as it is highly rated by food critics. I would have a look at the reviews to check how many people actually got food poisoning, cause even though they have a high rating by food critics they can get payed to write the reviews. Whereas the reviews online can be made out of hate but most of them are generally real. Also would double check if they have any awards or if they are always booked out and busy as it can reveal if the restaurant is good or bad. My final choice would probably be to just go to the resutratn because I tried to communicate but if they didn't respond they can not complain.
