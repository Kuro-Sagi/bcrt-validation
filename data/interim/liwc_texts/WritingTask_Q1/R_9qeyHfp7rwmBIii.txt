Ugh, you’ve got to be kidding me. Three hours before dinner and now Friend A suddenly cares? Where was this energy when I asked for help a month ago? I chased them up, they ghosted me, and I ended up doing everything myself; finding the place, reading reviews, paying the deposit out of my own pocket. And it’s non-refundable too. I remember this place had a good write-up in that food magazine and most of the Google reviews were fine. There were a couple of bad ones, but seriously, every restaurant has a few horror stories. It doesn’t mean it’s a death trap. Also, even if we wanted to change restaurants now, it’s a Saturday night. . I get being cautious, but this just feels like them trying to avoid responsibility again. Honestly, unless someone else wants to fork out hundreds of dollars for a new place and sort a backup plan within the next hour, we’re sticking to the original restaurant. I’m not throwing away the effort I put in or the money
