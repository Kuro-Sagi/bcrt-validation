I would tell Friend A that we are going to the place I booked because they did not respond to me and I had to make a decision in order to celebrate Friend B's birthday. Unless Friend A can give me another booking within the hour I would not change my mind. I would also be very annoyed with Friend A as they had ample time to help choose but they left it to the last minute. I would also trust the food critics over the google reviews as they are much more reliable. There is no way to change plans within 3 hours of going to the booking and I would tell Friend A that they should've told me sooner. I would keep the booking for the main reason that there is no time to change it and food critics are more reliable.
