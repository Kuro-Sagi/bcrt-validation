I would be extremely suspicious as the person agreed to the dinner in the first place and the fact that she is bailing would not make me happy. I would tell them that the place has great reviews and there is nothing to worry about. I would trust that the food is not poisoned as many other platforms would warn me about it but they didn’t. I would just go even if friend a wasn’t going because of the non refundable reservation.
