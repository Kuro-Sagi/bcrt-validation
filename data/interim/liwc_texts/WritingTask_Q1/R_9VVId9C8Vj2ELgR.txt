I feel frustrated that I was forced to organise the dinner by myself and now my friend is critiquing it even though they had no participation. I would not say anything to friend A to spoil their dinner, but would be cautious about friend B and potentially bring the situation up at a later date if it was appropriate. I would trust my own research and my opinion of the resturant, potentially looking it up again but still believing my own judgement. At this point in time, and without friend B's input, they don't really have a leg to stand on to judge my choice. I would ultimately stick with my decision, online reviews are often very specific to a particular issue and not always indicative of the resturant as a whole.
