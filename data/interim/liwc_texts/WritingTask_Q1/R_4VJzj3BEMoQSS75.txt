Hey so that's not really fair, like I get that some google reviews are bad, but you didn't text me back and only now you bring this up? I think we should go, just warn friend B about possible food poisoning, besides, I already paid for a non-refundable deposit and I would hate for it to go to waste. If I didn't have to pay a non-refundable deposit then I'd straight away go to a new restaurant, but you didn't tell me early enough. Truthfully I'd ok with going to another restaurant but i don't know if there would be any spots available since its very late. Also, this restaurant has great reviews from food critics so I think it should be alright, but before I think we should go ask friend B's opinion since it's their birthday. If they want to go to another restaurant then we can go, but I think we should keep the booking for now since the deposit has been paid, we don't have much time until we actually meet up to find another place and there are plenty of good reviews.
