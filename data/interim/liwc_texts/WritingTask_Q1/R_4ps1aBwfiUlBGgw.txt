A. Are you kidding?!? first you stop helping me plan and now you're gonna critic my choice, even tho you had no decency to even attempt to help me. I have also paid a nonrefundable deposit for this, ugh! is honestly so annoying and lowkey disrespectful. B. Sorry but I already paid the deposit and the reviews from food critics say it is a really good restaurant. If you had said before I booked we definitely could have changed, but it's bit late now. C. I have already chosen and the fact I had to pay a deposit shows this restaurant is quite fancy compared to others, I feel like it is quite this restaurant would not have food poisoning. D. no, once my mind is set. It is set and the food critics prove that it sounds like a good restaurant and unlikely that there would be food poisoning.
