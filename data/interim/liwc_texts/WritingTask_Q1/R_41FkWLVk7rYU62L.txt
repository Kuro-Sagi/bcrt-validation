they should've told me they had an issue when i first asked them. no way im changing it this late. i'll kindly tell them we should still give it a go because its been given lots of other good reviews. it's not their choice to move it seeing as they didn't help at all with booking. also, i'll suggest that if we do decided to move it, she'll have to suggest a new restaurant and split the deposit with me seeing as I did all the work. I mean I guess i understand her concern, but why couldnt she have said something earlier. everything is always so last minute with her. oh well i'll message and suggest we leave it and see what she says, maybe it was only a few reviews, she does tend to get worried about that sort of stuff. it'll be fine.
