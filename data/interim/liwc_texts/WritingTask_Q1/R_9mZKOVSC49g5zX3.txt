My first instinct might have been something like, "What? Are you serious? After I asked and got a silent response, and finally I had to make the decision all by myself after a month?" I might have felt frustrated and doubtful. I might have said to A, but now there are only three hours left. If we need to look for a new restaurant now, we might not be able to find a suitable one. And did many people say that in your comment? Or was it just an exception? If it was an exception, it might be caused by reasons such as competitors or guests having poor digestion, etc. Or we could also check on the local health bureau government platform to see if there are any public information about this restaurant. This should be relatively authoritative information. And I heard that the food critics of this restaurant have very high ratings. If we can't confirm that we can't find a suitable restaurant, perhaps we could also try this restaurant. Finally, because of these official information, multiple comments from various sources, the costs we have already paid and that are irrecoverable, I decided to keep the reservation.
