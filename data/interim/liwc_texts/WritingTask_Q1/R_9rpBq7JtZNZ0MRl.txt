I would feel a bit confused and annoyed that Friend A had not helped me to find the restaurant and had only communicated with me to criticise my choice of restaurant. I would ask him where he got this review from and how long it was ago. I would also ask him why he didnâ€™t tell me about this earlier and ask if he personally does not want to go to this restaurant. I would look at the recency of the review to see if it was trustworthy and also see if there are any other reviews saying the same thing. If there are more reviews which are recent that say this place has given them food poisoning, I would look for another restaurant but if not I would keep the reservation.
