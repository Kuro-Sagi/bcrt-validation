My first gut reaction after reading Friend B’s message is confusion and a bit of doubt. Part of me feels slightly anxious—what if Friend B is right and we’re making a mistake sticking to the original plan? But another part of me feels defensive, like, "Wait, we already booked this for a reason; I shouldn’t just change everything based on one message." Emotionally, I feel torn between wanting to trust Friend B (since they might know something important) and not wanting to overreact. If I had to say something to Friend A right away, I’d probably say, “Hey, B messaged me about this—do you think we should look into it? Maybe we should double-check before making a decision.” I wouldn’t outright cancel anything yet; I’d want to discuss it with Friend A first since we planned this together. When it comes to deciding what’s trustworthy, I’d think about how reliable Friend B usually is. Do they normally share accurate info, or do they overreact? I’d also check if they provided any evidence or if it’s just their opinion. If it’s something important, I might look online or ask someone else who’s been there recently. Before choosing, I’d definitely do some quick research—maybe check reviews, schedules, or official updates—and talk to Friend A about it. I wouldn’t want to waste money or ruin the plan based on a rumor. My final choice: I’d keep the booking unless I find solid evidence that changing plans is necessary. Right now, Friend B’s message alone isn’t enough for me to switch. But I’d stay open to changing if I find reliable confirmation.
