What is wrong with Friend A? How are they not going to help at all then have something to complain about. My response would be "Hey, so you actually ghosted me when I was looking for restaurants for Friend B. Since I've already paid a non-refundable deposit, unless you are willing to cover it, I think it would be best to just go. If you don't feel like coming, please don't.
