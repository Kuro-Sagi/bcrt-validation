When Friend A suddenly messaged about food poisoning claims at the restaurant, I felt a surge of frustration and suspicion. After being unresponsive for weeks, why raise concerns just three hours before dinner? The timing seemed calculated to create panic rather than solve problems. My immediate reply would be: *"Is this a recent review? The restaurant has excellent critic ratings, and we stand to lose our deposit. Honestly, why wait until the last possible moment to mention this?"* To properly assess the situation, I'd: 1. Thoroughly examine the Google review - checking dates, credibility of the reviewer, and whether others reported similar issues 2. Cross-reference with other review platforms and food blogs 3. Call the restaurant directly to ask about recent health inspections 4. Quickly research backup options, though chances of finding something good last-minute would be slim **Final Decision:** If the negative review appears to be an isolated incident amid overwhelmingly positive feedback, I'd keep the reservation - trusting professional critics' opinions over one questionable online review. The lost deposit would also factor into this decision. However, if I found multiple credible reports of recent health issues, I'd immediately contact Friend B to discuss alternatives, even if it meant paying another deposit elsewhere. Ultimately, I wouldn't let Friend A's eleventh-hour intervention derail plans without concrete evidence, but would prioritize everyone's safety if legitimate concerns emerged.
