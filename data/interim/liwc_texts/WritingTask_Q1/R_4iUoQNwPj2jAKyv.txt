I would be upset that friend A did not help with finding and booking a reservation somewhere. I would ask why friend A did not help with finding a restaurant and would tell them that we are keeping the booking because I had to pay for it and it is non-refundable. I would also show them the good food reviews and just tell them that it is too late to change and that the food poisoning was most likely a one time thing.
