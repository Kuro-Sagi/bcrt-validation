A. My gut feeling would be anger and annoyance. Frustrated by why the person completely ignored my texts when I asked for help booking, and now they suddenly swoop in with screenshots warning about food poisoning. Would also want to mention that they could’ve mentioned this when I was organising everything. B. Looking closer, the screenshots are just from random Google users. I know how unreliable those can be and there are chance that this might not even be related to the restaurant. C. I remind myself the restaurant has been praised by food critics, which holds much more weight. Still, I want to be sure, so I would check other platforms. D. No i wouldnt change my plan, just because some reviews were bad doesn't mean it will happen to everyone and plus at this point, changing plans would be chaos. Most nearby places are fully booked, the deposit is non-refundable, and there’s no convincing evidence this restaurant is unsafe. My decision: keep the booking. I’ll reassure Friend A and Friend B, explain the critic reviews, and move forward because one or two dodgy reviews aren’t enough to ruin Friend B’s birthday dinner.
