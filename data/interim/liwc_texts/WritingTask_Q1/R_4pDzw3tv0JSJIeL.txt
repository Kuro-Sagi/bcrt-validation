seriously? Friend A is only telling me this three hours before dinner? I’m a bit annoyed because they didn’t help at all with the booking and now they’re suddenly concerned. My gut reaction is that this feels like overreacting — the restaurant has good reviews from professional food critics, which I trust more than a few random Google Reviews. People complain online for all sorts of reasons, and sometimes those reviews aren’t even reliable. I’d probably reply to Friend A with something like, “I get your concern, but it’s really last minute, and this place has been highly rated by critics. Are you sure those reviews aren’t just isolated incidents?” To be sure, I’d quickly double-check the restaurant’s latest reviews, maybe scan their social media or any recent news about food safety. If there’s no widespread report of food poisoning, I’ll keep the booking. Final choice: I’ll keep the booking because the critic reviews and lack of recent serious complaints seem more trustworthy, and changing plans now would be stressful and possibly ruin Friend B’s birthday.
