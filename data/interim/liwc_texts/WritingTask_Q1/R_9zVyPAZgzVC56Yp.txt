we're still going to go to this restaurant. You didn't respond to my messages until 3 hours before we were going when we were planning it for a whole month. I would rather trust food critics whose job it is to judge food over some random person on google critics "claiming" to get food poisoning from their meal. Plus the surrounding restaurants are already full and I already paid for the reservation and can't get my money back. We're eating at this restaurant cause you haven't responded to my texts, there's no place else to go and I already paid for it and can't get a refund.
