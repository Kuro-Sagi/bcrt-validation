I would feel very disappointed at the thought of having to cancel a nicely prepared dinner reservation for Friend B. I would tell Friend A that this restaurant has really good views and the food poisoning situations may not directly apply to this restaurant, as well as having paid for the reservation. I would ask Friend A what source she is receiving food poisoning information from in case it is just lies for bad reviews on certain restaurants. Further actions I could take would be to show her pictures of the restaurant's reviews and to find any reviews of food poisoning.
