I would be quite confused initially but wouldn't really care about the concerns as the food critics gave great reviews initially. Maybe be a bit anoyed that they ignored me but wouldn't be that concerned. “Hey, I get the concern, but I wish you brought this up earlier when I asked for help. I already paid a non-refundable deposit and the restaurant has great critic reviews too.” I might glance at the reviews myself just to be sure, but unless the top ten all say “food poisoning,” I’m not worried. Plus, I already paid the deposit and it’s non-refundable, so changing plans now feels like a waste. Everywhere else is probably booked anyway. I would go in with the plan and message them that it should be fine but I would most likely finalise the plan when we meet up together. If over text they don't mind eating then that would be fine, but if they show some resistance then we would talk it further in person.
