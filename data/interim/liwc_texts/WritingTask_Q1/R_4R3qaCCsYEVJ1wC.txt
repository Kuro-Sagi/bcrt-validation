A. Fairly annoyed at friend A for not saying anything earlier especially since they didn't reply to messages. B. I'd probably say something like "ok, maybe we could ask the group what they think? Just a bit scared we won't be able to get a booking anywhere else this late..." C. Food critic reviews seem more trustworthy, but also to me any reviews indicating food poisoning would plant a slight seed of doubt, that doesn't tend to be something people lie about. D. I'd probably read the reviews for myself and see if they seem truthful. I'd probably change the plans provided we could get a booking somewhere else, but if not wouldn't cancel as long as the groups okay with it.
