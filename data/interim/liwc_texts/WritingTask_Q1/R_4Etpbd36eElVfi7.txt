Initially, I would have felt betrayed, annoyed and disrespected by my friend. Since we had planned to book a place together, if feels like they are leeching off my time and efforts to do something, and then for them to chime in at the end to try and be 'helpful' in some way, irritates me. I would immediately let Friend A know that I have had my trust and respect breached, as they didn't seem to care for my time at all, and I would also tell them that they were arrogant and disrespectful to suggest to switch restaurants after I had spent time planning and booking things. I would trust my research, and stick to the restaurant I had already planned, as I had seen proper food critics, and I would Friend B know of what Friend A has done, and tell Friend A that if they were to do it again, I just wouldn't invite them next time.
