I would feel annoyed at Friend A for bringing this up so late after not contributing to the planning and leaving the job to me. I would say to Friend A that I had to pay a non-refundable deposit and other restaurants are all booked out so we should probably go to the restaurant anyways. But i would also ask if they had any other restaurants they could find and book. I would look at the reviews to see if there are any more people who got food poisoning but i would probably insist it was a rare happening and ignore it to go to the restaurant instead. Ultimately, i would keep the booking because I paid the deposit and other venues are mostly full.
