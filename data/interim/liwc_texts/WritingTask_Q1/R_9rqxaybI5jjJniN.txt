Firstly, the evaluation of this restaurant has always been high. Is it true that there have been cases of poisoning among diners on Google, and is it a common occurrence? If so, consider changing the restaurant. If not, from the perspective that the deposit cannot be refunded and the surrounding restaurants are already fully booked, there is no need to change the restaurant. In addition, after booking the restaurant, friend A did not immediately communicate about the situation of their own restaurant. They only expressed their opinions now, which may not be because they have any objections to the restaurant itself, but only because they have their own ideas for this birthday party. Considering multiple factors such as the non refundable deposit, the infrequent occurrence of poisoning incidents among diners, and the lack of suitable restaurants for modification in the surrounding area, it was ultimately decided not to change the restaurant.
