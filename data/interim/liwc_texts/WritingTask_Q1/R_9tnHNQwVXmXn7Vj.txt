I feel unbelievable that my friend A didn't tell me that some diners got food poisoning early when I was finding that restaurant hardly. During the time I was finding the restaurant, you (friend A) didn't give me or suggest any ideas, but when I finally decided which restaurant we were going to help friend B celebrate his birthday, you just jumped out and told me that we should not go to this restaurant. I will tell friend A to shut up because it is too late for changing the restaurant. Also, I would tell friend A some Google reviews may not be true; we can't just read those reviews on Google and decide not to go to the restaurant. However, I will see a review of the restaurant again to check if it is just a random accident. I will try my best to find out the real information.
