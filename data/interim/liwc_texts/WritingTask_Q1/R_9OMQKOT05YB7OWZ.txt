A. I would be happy knowing that my friend didn't ghost me intentionally but was probably busy with something. But a part of me would be pissed that friend A wasn't being cooperative, and that I paid for the dinner already, as it's non - refundable. I'd honestly tell friend A to let me see how many google reviews mentioned food poisoning, and see if they were frequent or not. The time stamps matter as well, because i'd look at how long ago the critiques were made, and when the reviews were made. Now i'd also look into the dishes in the review that caused the food poisoning, and would see if it's something easily irritable to the stomach. If there were no dishes mentioned, i'd check the other reviews of the person who wrote the google review to see if it was similar. Honestly, as it is friend B's birthday, i'd call them and ask what they would prefer, as it's their birthday.
