My immediate reaction would be that Friend A simply doesn't want to go to the place I selected. Regardless of these reviews, she chose to ignore the good ones. Hence, it feels as if there are ulterior motives; she possibly wanted to act as a hero and 'outshine' me, to make a more favourable impression on Friend B. A lot of places do have bad reviews, and it's easy to avoid certain meals if you're paranoid. It isn't fair to discredit critics and a restaurant by only trusting a few Google reviews. If it was such an issue, she could have researched it prior before I booked and made more of an effort to find a place that she was also satisfied with. I could have made more efforts to read the reviews; however, I did see the critic reviews, which should suffice. I will keep the booking, as if there was an issue, she could have brought it up to me earlier rather than last minute.
