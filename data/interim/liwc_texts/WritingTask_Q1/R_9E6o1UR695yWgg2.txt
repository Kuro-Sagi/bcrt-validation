I think Friend A is an abololute slacker and if they wanna be picky they shouldve pulled their weight but they didn't so they can suck it up. I would tell them how late it is to be changing plan and also it's not about how they feel it's about Friend B and they can just starve to death if they dont wanna eat. Also there are so many ways to get sick there's no way to tell how they got the food poisoning and maybe Friend A should stfu because some people actually do stuff other than whinge and be flaky. I'd keep the plans, unless Friend B said otherwise, and if they did, I'd be quietly pissed off.
