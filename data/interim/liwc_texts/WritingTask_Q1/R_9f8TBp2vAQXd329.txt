When I first read Friend A's message, I would be annoyed as she didn't respond to my texts when I asked for her opinion and help which I have to do everything on my own. I would reply to her chats by telling how we already booked the restaurant and that I already search for food critics review before I booked this restaurant, that most restaurants nearby is already full if we cancelled on this one. I would also tell her that I already paid the deposit for this restaurant and that it is non-refundable. If the food critic review is in a form of video in social media, I would send her the link so that Friend A can see, but if it is in the form of text, I would just send her a screenshot of the proof that I researched about the restaurant before booking. I would believe food critics as I am sure that these critics must have tasted every food in every restaurants which I'm sure if they said its good then it must be very good. Eventually, I would keep the booking as most of the restaurants with good food must be very packed already especially for walk-ins.
