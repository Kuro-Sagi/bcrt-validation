I would be annoyed and irritated that Friend A would have the audacity to complain about my choice of restaurant when s/he did not help at all. I would then also feel like friend a is undermining my ability and to think that I would reserve a restaurant without looking at reviews would slightly offend me. It would have been better had it been not three hours before the dinner, and if that friend had checked other platforms other than just google. I would say to Friend A that I chose that restaurant based on food critiques and could not get her feedback since she did not respond to my text. I would ask her to at least try it out considering how difficult it is to book other restaurants right now. I would not show irritatedness since it would start the night on the wrong foot. I would accept the information from google review but will keep in mind of food critiques as well. I would think that the food critiques may be biased if they are promoted, and owning up to that. I would end up doing further research and if its all accurate and consistent then I would proceed with compromising with friend a and reassuring her to go to the planned restaurant.
