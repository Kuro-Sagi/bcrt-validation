A. Immediately after Friend A brings this to my attention, I would feel very irritated and upset by them. B. I would tell them that I had already made the reservation a month in advance, which they were aware of. Knowing this, they could have informed me of the bad Google Reviews earlier, instead of telling me on the day when it was too late. I would also say that I gave them the opportunity to help me find a restaurant and provide their input, but they chose to ignore my messages. So it wouldn't be fair for Friend A to suggest that we shouldn't go 3 hours prior to the booking, when they deliberately chose to stop responding to my texts during the initial stages of planning. I would also voice that they're not respecting my time since they decided to inform me of the poor ratings on the day of the event, leaving me with little to no options on what to do. C. Although I have a high amount of respect for food critics, I would regard the numerous accounts of food poisoning from other customers more. I think this ties in with my own personal experiences with food poisoning from restaurants before, so I would like to try my best to avoid it from happening again. D. Before making a decision on what to do next, I would consult the other guests, but most importantly, Friend B. I would value their decision the most since it's their birthday. Overall, I would choose to change plans despite how annoyed I would be, especially considering the non-refundable booking. However, I would rather lose that money than take chances at everyone getting food poisoning and ruining the celebration even more.
