When I received a text message from my friend A, I felt a little angry and helpless at the same time. A month ago, I contacted him to ask him to share the planning tasks with me, but he didn't respond at all. In the end, I did everything myself and paid the non-refundable deposit out of my own pocket. Now, with only three hours left before dinner, he suddenly pops up and says, ‘Maybe we shouldn't go.’ This really makes me feel unfair. The most critical issue is that changing restaurants at this point is extremely difficult. We booked quite late, and the popular restaurants in this area are likely already fully booked. Changing locations at the last minute could ruin Friend B’s birthday, especially if we can’t find a new place to eat. B has been looking forward to tonight, and I don’t want him to feel like we didn’t prepare properly.
