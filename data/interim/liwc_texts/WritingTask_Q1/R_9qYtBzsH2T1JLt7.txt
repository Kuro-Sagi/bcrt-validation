i felt very gutted when the friend sent the negative reviews of the restaurant, and there is some doubt in my mind about the legitimacy of those reviews, as I remember the restaurant having some positive reviews in regards to its atmosphere and the food there. I would ask friend a where they got and sourced the information from, as it would be highly unlikely they got the information from a reputable source if i have already read the reviews and they were all, if not, mostly positive about the restaurant. I would consider where i got the info from, as well as my friend, and i will use that information to decide which info is trustworthy and which ones aren’t. I’ wont take any actions before choosing I would change plans
