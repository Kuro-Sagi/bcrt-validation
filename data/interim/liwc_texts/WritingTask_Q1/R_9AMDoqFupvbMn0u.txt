(There's probably a typo? As we received the message from A instead of B, my response will be under the circumstance of where the message comes from A instead of B) I would be disappointed and displeased as I'm about to lose money when I first received A's message. I would then check the google review myself to see how recent the food poisoning occurred. If it happened within this week, I would suggest eating takeout at whoever's house, if not I would try to convince them to go. I would overall try to keep the situation light as its B's birthday and I do not want to cause any tension. So I will probably respond with a surprised emoji. Regarding A's lack of response a month prior I would no longer ask for their opinion and instead take full control of the situation. Overall, I will change plans for us, as I don't want my friend risk to get diarrhoea on their birthday. But because I don't want to waste money, I would check if I can change booking date and go by myself some other time.
