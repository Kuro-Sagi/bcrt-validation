immediate gut/emotional reaction of how it is not fair for friend A to be sending a message like that when it is so last minute. i believe that that message implies that we should go somewhere else, but it is already the day of and the booking has already been made. we had a long time to plan/discuss/research about where we should go, yet they didn't contribute, so they don't get the right to randomly get their two cents right before the party happens and we listen to them. I would say something along the lines of "oh no that's not good, but i do remember looking at reviews before showing more positive responses, and its too late now to change venues". i wouldn't really care about which information is trustworthy, i would still want to go to the restaurant that was initially booked, just out of spite of them (and their lack of work).
