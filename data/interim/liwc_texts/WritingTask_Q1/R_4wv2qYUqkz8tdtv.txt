Depends on how close me and Friend A is. If we are not literally best friends, i'll be like whatever and handle it myself. Also depends on how much the deposit is, i'll be pretty sour and think negatively about friend A, however it's likely i'll keep this to myself as it is a non-issue in a grand perspective. Then when friend A ask me about changing restaurant, i'll ask why they haven't contact me earlier and ask more proof about this food poisoning review, if they do have sufficient evidence, i'll ask them what is their plan. If they have a good plan, great, they own up to their mistake and i'll go with it, otherwise i'll call them on their actions. It's likely i'll continue with what i'm doing, friend A is unreliable, a few google reviews can be misleading, and there isnt a lot of options remaining anyways.
