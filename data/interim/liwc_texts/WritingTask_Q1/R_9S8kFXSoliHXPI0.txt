I would feel frustrated as friend A has ghosted me for months but suddenly appeared and disrupting my plans. I would tell friend A that I have already paid deposit for it so there is no other option but go to the restaurant I have book. in deciding information that is trustworthy, I would read and compare the overall google comments and decide whether the restaurant is worth visiting. I would keep the booking. This is not only because of that I have paid a non-refundable deposit, but also the fact that a single comment of the restaurant has food poisoning might not be trustworthy. Moreover, friend A only rejected my plan but did not give out alternative solutions, giving me no reasons to change my plan.
