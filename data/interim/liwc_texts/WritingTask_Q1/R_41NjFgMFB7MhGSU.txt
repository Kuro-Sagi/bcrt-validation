My first reaction would be frustrated and think why does Friend A bring this up now 3 hours right before the dinner after ghosting me during the planning. I would also feel a bit nervous because the deposit is non-refundable and finding another restaurant last minute is stressful. But, I would just have reply something like "Hey, I wish you could mentioned this earlier since this deposit is non-refundable. Do you have specific concerns or just nervous about the google review?" I would check the other social media other than just google review if there are lots of bad reviews around one date or not then it might be isolated incident. I'll go through recent social media tags and see if diners posted about the issue. Last, I'll check if Friend B has any dietary restrictions that could cause the risk. I would keep the booking as Friend A say all this too late and it is a waste of time and money. If Friend A is uncomfortable, I would suggest to join later for drinks or dessert instead.
