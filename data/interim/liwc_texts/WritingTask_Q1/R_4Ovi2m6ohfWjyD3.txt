Are you serious right now bruh? 3 hours before the dinner you decide to respond to my messages. You left me on delivered this whole time while I was planning for the dinner and only decide to pop up now. I've done some research and the place I found has reviews from food critics which say the restaurant is fine. Furthermore, the information that says we could get food poisoning could have really been useful before I paid the deposit for the dinner. We are are keeping the booking.
