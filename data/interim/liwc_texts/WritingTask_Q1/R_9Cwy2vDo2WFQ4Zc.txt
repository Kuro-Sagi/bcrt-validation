a. a little bit frustrated, inconvenient and unnecessary chimming in. it nice that friend A wants to help, but it is too little to late, that's a bit annoying. coming out of nowher,e providing useless feedback at an unhelpful time. b. "hey, yeah i see what you are saying, but i did extensivly check the reviews before booking and it looks like that was jsut a one-off thing. ive already booked this current place and my booking is non refundable. would it be ok if we just give this place a try think it could be really nice. if we get there and the vibes are off wecan change it up. c. im assuming that because i booked this so far in advance, i would have previously and carefully checked reviews. i would have also compared options. ultimately i would suggest we stick with the origional booking just to give it a go becuase most other places would be booked i had done the previous research and if we show up and have a bad feeling we can always change in that moment. no point disaster planning yet
