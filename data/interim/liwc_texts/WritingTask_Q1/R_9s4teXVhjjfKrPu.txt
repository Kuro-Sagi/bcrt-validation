Ugh, are you serious. Now Friend A wants to weigh in, three hours before the dinner? Where was this energy when I asked for help a month ago? I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit, and the place was reviewed well by actual food critics, not just random people on Google Reviews. I get that food poisoning is serious, but online reviews can be so hit-or-miss. One bad night and people go off, I need to be more objective. I want to text Friend A something like, “Appreciate the concern, but I asked you weeks ago for input and didn’t hear back. It’s way too late to change plans now, especially since I paid a deposit and most restaurants are fully booked.”
