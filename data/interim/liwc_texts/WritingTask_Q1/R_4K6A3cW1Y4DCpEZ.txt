anger because why do you only care 3 hours before the booking when i had asked 1 month ago. agitated too. since i am non confrontational i would tell them to look for other options since i am currently busy and say that i missed those reviews when i was booking to mitigate any blame on me. I would say i am busy even if i wasnt because i already out the initial effort and they were unresponsive so it is there turn now. i would verify the google review. but also it could just be that one persons luck but to ensure i dont get blamed id be extra cautious. I would change my plans to avoid the possible drama of the other person saying i am negligent in my restaurant search.
