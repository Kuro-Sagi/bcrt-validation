Initally I'd be really annoyed! Why on earth would you give this kind of info so near the time. I'd suggest that we take a look at more reviews and that I don't always trust these anyone, anyone only reports negative, no one responds positively to these things! Say let's go ahead with it, keep our fingers crossed it's OK and if not make it in to a fun night, somethign we can talk about. However, I would say, next time you're in charge of booking!
