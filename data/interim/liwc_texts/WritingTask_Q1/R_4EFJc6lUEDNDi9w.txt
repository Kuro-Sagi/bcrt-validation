I would propably still go to the restaurant. I may confuse about why A know I book this restaurant and why stop responding my text before but now giving me feedback, is there anything wrong with A and B? Then, I would check the Googld review and other social media to verify the "food poisoning". I would thank A for the reminder and ask her why she didn't reply to my message. And I will judge my previous doubts based on A's response. I would consiser although there is food poisoning, it a matter of probability -- bad experiences can happen occasionally. Since this place has strong review from food critics, the deposit cannot be refund and most other retaurants are already fully booked, I think it is still worth going.
