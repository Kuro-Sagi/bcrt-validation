Are they really sending this message now? They weren't trying to help me a month ago. I won't reply back with anything yet - I need time to think. I remember seeing that there were great reviews from food critics from this place. I should check when these negative Google reviews were made. I did pay a non-refundable deposit though, so unless I find out that the reviews were recent or a common experience, I will keep the booking.
