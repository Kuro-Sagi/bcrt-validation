I would be extremely pissed and tell Friend A that maybe he should have said something earlier and actually contributed instead of commenting ONLY 3 hours before the dinner, either come or don't it's not my problem anymore. I would be disregarding his opinion and go anyway as I trust my research more and I would tell him off for being condescending and unhelpful. He did not put in any of the effort and only nudged for this near the actual deadline just three hours before the actual dinner, what say does he have compared to me, should have just kept his mouth shut. I would keep the booking plans.
