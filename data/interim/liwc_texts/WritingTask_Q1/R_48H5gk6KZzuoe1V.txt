Oh no! I can't believe this is happening just three hours before dinner. My first gut reaction is fustration- I asked Friend A to help plan this weeks ago, and now they suddenly come up with this warning at the last minute. I'm also worried about the risk: food poisoning is serious, but I also remember this restaurant has excellent reviews from professional food critics. I would probably reply to Friend A riight away:"Thanks for flagging this- let me check quickyly, we can't afford to cancel for no reason." Then I would try to figure out whether these Google reviews are trustworthy. Are they recent? Do they look genuine or exaggerated? I might also check other review sites like Yelp or TripAdvisor for consistency. Given that we’re so close to the dinner time, I’d probably also call the restaurant directly to ask if they’ve had any health inspection issues recently. After weighing everything, unless there are many recent complaints, I’d keep the booking. The deposit is non-refundable, most restaurants nearby are likely fully booked, and the food critics’ reviews give me confidence. So my final decision would be: keep the reservation but stay cautious, and inform Friend B and the group so they can choose to go or not.
