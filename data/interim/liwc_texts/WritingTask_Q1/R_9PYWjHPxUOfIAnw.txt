I would feel that friend A backstab me, they don't help me to find and book a restaurant, but they are dissatisfied with the restaurant I chose. Friend A would even send the screenshots to friend B, and friend B would also be dissatisfied with me. I will not respond friend A's text, and keep the booking. Because whatever I reply, they can stop responding again. I do not want to make friend B unhappy, so it is necessary to keep this restaurant. I will check the review of this restaurant again to make sure it is safe. If positive reviews are the majority, I will believe this restaurant is good. Finally, I will send screenshots of great reviews from food critics to friend B, and keep a distance from friendA in the future.
