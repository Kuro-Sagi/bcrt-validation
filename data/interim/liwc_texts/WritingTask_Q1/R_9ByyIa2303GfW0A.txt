My initial reaction would be annoyed, frustrated and confused as to why Friend A hadn't responded until the day of the dinner. I would then tell him that I had already booked everything and paid for everything, and the critic reviews I had seen were different to the Google Reviews. I would provide screenshots and evidence for the critic reviews, but also take into account the Google reviews to make sure those comments weren't reliable. I would then let Friend A know how disrespectful their actions are, and how difficult and stressful the situation they made was for me. I would finally also let them know that I would tell Friend B of the things Friend A did.
