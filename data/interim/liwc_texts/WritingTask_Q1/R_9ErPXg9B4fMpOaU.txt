I would feel irritated as Friend A did not contribute to the conversation and only decided to abruptly chime in before the event. This lacks communication and implies their lack of consideration and care on behalf of others. I would tell them that it's non-refundable and we would have to attend as it's inconsiderate to change plans right before the event. I would offer an ultimatum, if friend A is able to find an alternative restaurant and pay their share (the full fee) of the booking, we could consult with friend B and find an alternative place instead. The chances of that it unlikely though as it's hard to negotiate and find alternative time and place again. In regards to the restaurants review, if the OVERALL impression of the restaurant is good then it's best to attend it either way. The likely hood of food poisoning is rare and it applies for EVERY restaurant. Personally, I would've stuck with the same booking if the Friend A isn't willing to pay for the full fee on the alternative restaurant.
