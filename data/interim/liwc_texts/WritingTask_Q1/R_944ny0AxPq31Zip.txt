A. Very annoyed and upset. I can't believe they finally decided to speak up at a point where nothing can be done to fix it. I'd feel as though they thought their judgement was better than mine and I'd be slightly panicked as well because of the lack of time to find a place everyone would enjoy. B. I'd probably let their response sit for a while after I'd seen it as a way to channel my anger about their lack of response. Then I would text back something along the lines of "If you can find a better restaurant to go to, I'm down otherwise we are going to x restaurant in 3 hours". I'd also attatch screenshots of the critic reviews I saw. C. I would look at overall ratings and also the extreme 5 star and 1 star reviews to see if anything seemed off about them. I'd also check multiple websites and potentially Tiktoks. D. I'd consider what the birthday person likes and if their preferences are closer to mine or friend A's before I make my final decision. I would keep the booking as there doesn't seem to be enough time to make new plans that would be equally well organised. I would perhaps suggest friend A to choose a dessert place in case the restaurant was bad to make sure the night ends well and both of us had input in the planning.
