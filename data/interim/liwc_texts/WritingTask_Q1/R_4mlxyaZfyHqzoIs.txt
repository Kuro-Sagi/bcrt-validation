Friend A should have brought these concerns up when we were discussing options, it is now too late. I would say to friend A 'you shiuld have been more involved and your laziness has affected the decision making, it should'nt be solely up to me'. I am trusting the numerous reviews saying the restaurant is good rather than 1 instance of food poisoning, this is not cause for concern yet. Google reviews are not always truthful anyway. I would look at the reviews myself and see if they are legitimate and also look at when they were written, this could be old information that has since become a non-issue. I decide to keep the booking, there is not enough cause for concern, i have paid a deposit, and there is not enough time to find a new location. If the food is off we can leave and improvise a new plan.
