Oh no, I can’t believe this is happening just three hours before dinner. I’m honestly frustrated that Friend A is only getting back to me now, especially after ignoring my messages when I needed help planning. I already paid the deposit, and we don’t really have time to rebook somewhere else last minute. I’d probably text her back something like: “Where was this info earlier? I already paid for the booking, and the place has great critic reviews. I’ll double-check, but this is really late to raise it.” I’d also want to fact-check those reviews myself. Are those claims about food poisoning just a few one-star reviews? Or is there a pattern? I’d check the most recent Google and TripAdvisor reviews, maybe even the restaurant’s social media to see if they’ve posted anything or responded to complaints. If I can’t find solid proof of a problem, I’m inclined to go ahead. So my final choice is to keep the booking. It’s too late to make other arrangements, and there’s no strong evidence the restaurant is unsafe. I’ll ask Friend A to decide whether she’s still comfortable coming, but I’m not cancelling on Friend B’s birthday.
