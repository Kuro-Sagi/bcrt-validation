I already paid the non-refundable deposit for the booking and food critics have highly rated this restaurant. As with all restaurants, not everyone will have the same dining experience due to a number of variables. Friend A was meant to help out but did not help with choosing the restaurant in the end so Friend A does not get a say in deciding which restaurant to go to. While it is an annoying situation, we are already committed to this restaurant because no one else helped in deciding where to go and I have already incurred a cost in the non-refundable booking. Friend B trusts me enough to allow me to book the restaurant for their birthday, so the only reason for me to change plans is if Friend B tells me so, otherwise we keep the booking despite Friend A's late objection.
