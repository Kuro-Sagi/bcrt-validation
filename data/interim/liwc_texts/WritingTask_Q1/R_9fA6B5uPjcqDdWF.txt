A. Annoyed B. I would try to confront Friend A, but I would try to make it civil. C. Check if the reviews really say that there is food poisoning or not. D. I'd probably ask friend A if they had a problem with friend B or with the restaurant's pricing. I would try to recommend other restaurants if they didn't like the place/food/pricing, because we're trying to make a good birthday for friend B. D. Calming myself down to have a civil conversation with friend A. I'd try to rationalise and talk it out with friend A first before keeping the booking or changing plans, according to their decision.
