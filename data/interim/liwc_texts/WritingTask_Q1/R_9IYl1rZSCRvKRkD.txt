I would be frustrated at friend a, as they made no help to make plans and have now decided to suggest something different, after a nonrefundable deposit. I would say to friend a that I had only heard good stuff and seen really good reviews, that a nonrefundable deposit was paid and that they should have said something earlier. I would go and check reviews myself. depending on reviews I would most likely keep the booking as it is meant to be good and is non-refundable.
