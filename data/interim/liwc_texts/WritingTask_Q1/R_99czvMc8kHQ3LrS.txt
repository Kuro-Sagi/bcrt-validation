I would think about saying well, I already booked the restaurant so I can't really change that now since there is a non-refundable deposit, unless you're OK with paying me back that money. Also I would go back to Google and look at the reviews, if I was right and there were good reviews and would screenshot the reviews and send them to my friend. If they were bad reviews, I would not send them to my friend and instead say that when I booked it, there was already good reviews when I looked. Also if they really cared, they would've also gone to look at the reviews at the same time as me and responded to my message. My emotional reaction would be feeling guilty at first but then realising that actually there's nothing we can do about it now so there is no need to stress about it.
