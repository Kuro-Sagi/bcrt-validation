When Friend A suddenly texts me three hours before the dinner with screenshots of food poisoning reviews, my first reaction is frustration—why didn’t they help research earlier? I remind myself to stay calm and assess the situation. I compare the few negative Google reviews to the restaurant’s overall high ratings and professional critic endorsements, realizing isolated incidents don’t define the place. A quick check confirms most complaints are outdated or vague, while recent diners praise the food. Since canceling would mean losing the deposit and scrambling for a last-minute alternative, I decide to keep the booking. I’ll advise the group to avoid high-risk dishes and trust my initial research. If anything, Friend A owes me an explanation for disappearing—but for now, the birthday celebration goes on as planned.
