my immediate gut reaction would be annoyance, because friend A could have brought this up with me earlier. if they brought it up earlier, I could have changed the restaurant or not paid the non-refundable deposit. I'd probably say to friend a 'thanks for letting me know, however this restaurant has great reviews from food critics and I've already paid the deposit. also, there will be no where else to go at this time'. honestly, google reviews seem to be more reliable than food critics, since they may be paid to advertise the business. I would probably check if there are any undisclosed advertisements in the food critic reviews, as well as check whether the negative google reviews have anything in common (food poisoning associated with a specific dish). ultimately, I would keep the booking, because there probably isn't another restaurant open, and I'm annoyed at friend a for only helping at the last second.
