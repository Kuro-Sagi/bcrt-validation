Ugh, are you kidding me? Friend A is texting now? After ghosting me for a month when I needed help booking? My first thought is pure frustration—where were they when I was scrambling to find a place, putting down my own money for the deposit? Now, three hours before dinner, they’re suddenly an expert with Google Reviews? I should do a quick check: maybe look up the restaurant’s health inspection score online. Most places post that, and it’s a solid indicator. Also, text Friend B—maybe they’ve heard anything about the spot? But I don’t want to panic them. And, nearby venues are full. If we cancel, we might end up with no place for B’s birthday. The deposit is non-refundable, so that’s money down the drain. I’ll keep the booking. The critics’ reviews are more trustworthy, the timing is too tight to change, and Friend A’s sudden concern feels unearned. I’ll mention the health check to ease any worries, but we’re going.
