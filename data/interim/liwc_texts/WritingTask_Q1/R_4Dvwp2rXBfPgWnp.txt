I would feel frustrated and angry at my friend. This is because I would most likely recall how my friend did not respond and if they had helped earlier this would most likely not happen. I would also be feeling that way just about how this is happening so last minute. I would then message my friend complaining about how they did not respond and if they had helped this would not have happened. Then I would tell them about how there is good food reviews from critics but, and that I will check about how many food poisoning reviews are there, and wether they are over a long period of time or close to each other as if there reviews are over a long period of time then its better to look at other places, and also if there is more than 4 food poison reviews its again best to not go but if its less than 4 and over a spam of long period of time then we should just go as its very unlikely for anything to happen. I would still base our decisions on reviews as I feel like they are more trust worthy than food critics. After seeing the reviews, based on what I said, I would make a decision.
