I'd feel slightly annoyed that they only responded 3 hours before but also concerned as to why they'd stopped replying and only now decided that we should potentially cancel. I'd try to reassure my friend that there are only a few instances in which the food poisoning happened, and also let them know that I've paid a non-refundable deposit. I think that I would trust the information provided by food critics but would also validate my friend's concern regarding food poisoning. I'd double check if there are any other options available so we could potentially eat elsewhere, and if not keep the booking.
