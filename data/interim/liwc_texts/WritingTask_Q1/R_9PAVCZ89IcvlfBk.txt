What a shit friend. Firstly, they didn't even bother to come up with an excuse for ignoring my messages and now they send this? Honestly they can just piss off since they didn't contribute anything to this plan. If they'd just responded like a decent person and helped me book a restaurant this issue would've been resolved much earlier. Nothing can justify ghosting me up until the day, especially since this was meant to be a team effort for Friend B's birthday. I'm texting back, 'maybe YOU shouldn't go because their is no 'we' in this plan,' then proceed to find the direct source of their screenshot. I did the research and none of them ever mentioned bad food practices or quality so I trust my own decision. I'm going to find if other sources have reported food poisoning because it'll most likely be on the news if a renowned restaurant, reviewed by many critics, gave their diners food poisoning. I'm going to keep the booking because it's a non-refundable deposit and I don't want to cancel plans last minute especially since it is a special occasion for someone else.
