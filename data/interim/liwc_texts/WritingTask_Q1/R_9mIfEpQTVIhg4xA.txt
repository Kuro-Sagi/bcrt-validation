I am immediately annoyed at reading the text as the friend hadn't provided any help earlier. I then start to feel concern that ive chosen the wrong place but dont have time to book another. I would then look up the resturant again and read the reviews to see how recent the negative/positive ones are. After looking at this i would then text the friend back stating the reviews ive seen and the lack of available resturants to book due to the time. If the reviews were still mostly positive I would push to still go to the booked resturant.
