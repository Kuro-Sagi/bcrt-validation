My immediate reaction would be anger or annoyance as Friend A did not seem interested in helping. I would tell them about the critics reviews and say its worth giving it a go as its so last minute. I believe the information from critics is trustworthy as they do it as a job. I would look further into reliable sources about the validity of the food poisoning claims. I would keep the booking and ensure that the foood seems okay to eat, unless a more reliable solution was presented.
