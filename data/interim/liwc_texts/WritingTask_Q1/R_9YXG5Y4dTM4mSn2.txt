When reading Friend A's message that we shouldn't go, I would feel annoyed because they left the planning to me without any explanation, then wants to change the plans at the last minute when they can't exactly be changed. However I would try and put this aside, and ask them whether there's a lot of other good reviews on the site of diners who didn't get food poisoning. I would also ask when the reviews were posted, as if they were recent then I would ask Friend B if they're ok with still going to the restaurant, or if they'd rather go somewhere else since it's their birthday. I would also tell Friend A that we've already paid a deposit, and if they're unsure then we can order food that has less chance of causing food poisoning. If the bad reviews are old or outnumbered, then I would keep the booking. If the reviews are recent or there is a significant amount of them, then I would consult with Friend B and probably change plans.
