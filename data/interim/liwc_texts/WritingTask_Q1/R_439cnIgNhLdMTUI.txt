Immediately I would investigate into the google reviews tbat claim of getting food poisoning. Validity would be checked by the amount of reviews these individuals have given, how long ago these reviews were put and what other reviewers have said on google reviews. Following this, I would make a subjective decision whether the claims are valid right now. I would also check the reviews that have been given on other platforms, such as tripadvisor. If there is a pattern of a specific food giving food poisoning, then I would say to Friend A that we will just avoid that meal and order something else from there. If Friend A is still insisting on not having that restaurant, then I would tell them that the booking has already been made, and a deposit has been given. If they are willing to get a booking and take responsibility for finding another restaurant, then I am happy to change plans, else we will keep this booking.
