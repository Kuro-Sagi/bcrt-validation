Hey Friend A, how have you been? I read your message regarding the restaurant booking for tonight. That is crazy that some people have got food poisoning. I conducted my research and found that it had received great reviews from food critics. I asked for your opinion on where you should go, but you didn't say anything. I have already paid a non-refundable deposit for the reservation. What should we do? We stick to the plan and go because most other places are fully booked.
