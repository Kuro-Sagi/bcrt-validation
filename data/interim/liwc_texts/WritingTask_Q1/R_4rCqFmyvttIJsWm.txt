A. My immediate reaction is panic and likely some type of regret, but also likely disdain for my friend in bringing this up so late for the inconvenience. B. I'd probably go into denial and try to find other reviews, then let them know the deposit is non-refundable, maybe see if they'd be guilted into paying some portion of it for the late response. I'd probably react with shock generally then immediately scramble for a plan b. C. If there is a frequency of reviews then it is almost guaranteed to be true unless highly coordinated. I'd check news sources for this happening as there's a chance it could show up, and also maybe check something like a local subreddit for it. D. I'd honestly cycle through available free choices nearby, like a beach walk, clubbing, home hangout, or just going to a park. In some circumstances, I might immediately deny my friend and maybe sweeten the deal by paying for their food, even eating it and taking them to a different place later just so I can try the restaurant.
