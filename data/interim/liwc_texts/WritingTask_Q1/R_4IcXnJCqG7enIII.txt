Seriously? Three hours before the dinner? This is the first time Friend A’s messaging me about this after ghosting me a month ago when I asked for help. And now they suddenly care enough to send Google Reviews screenshots? Honestly, I’m frustrated. I’ve already put down a non-refundable deposit and organised everything because they went quiet. Where was this energy when we were trying to plan? As I already paid the deposit and there are limited options left at this point. Also, most of the reviews I saw were positive, including from professional critics. I'll keep the booking.
