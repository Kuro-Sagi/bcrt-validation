My immediate reaction was anger, and I asked friend A why she didn't mention the negative news about the restaurant before I asked for help or made a reservation. However, if this restaurant has ever caused a food poisoning incident, I must also take it seriously. I'll check to see if the negative review is from a long time ago and to see if there are other restaurants nearby that still have space. I also call restaurants directly to ask if they've had any recent customer complaints about their food, and look at recent trends in the review section to see if the negative review is an isolated phenomenon or repeated. In my opinion, if the comment about food poisoning is an exception, and the restaurant is highly praised by the gourmets, I will not easily change the restaurant temporarily, which is not only unfair, but also the non-refund of the reservation fee will cause me a loss.
