When I read the message from friend A, I felt a mix of frustration and annoyance. First of all, friend A ignored my request for help a month ago, leaving me to handle the restaurant - booking alone. And now, just three hours before dinner, they come up with this concern. I'd immediately reply to friend A, saying, "It's a bit late to bring this up now. I trusted your help before, but you left me hanging. And the food critics have given this place great reviews." To judge which information is trustworthy, I know that food critics usually base their reviews on in - depth tastings and research, while the random Google reviews might be one - sided or even false. So, I'd quickly check if there are any official health reports about the restaurant. I also considered calling the restaurant directly to ask about the food - poisoning claim. After making these checks and still finding no solid evidence of the food - poisoning incident, I'd decide to keep the reservation. The reason is that the positive reviews from food critics carry more weight, and it's too late to find another suitable restaurant with most nearby places fully booked.
