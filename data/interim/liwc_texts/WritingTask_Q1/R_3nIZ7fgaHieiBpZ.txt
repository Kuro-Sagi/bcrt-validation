Concerned because any reviews that say food poisoning is pretty worrisome, even if there are great reviews so id check the reviews again myself because friend A might be looking at the wrong thing. Id tell Friend A that ill check it again myself and to just wait till I finish doing so and to look for another restaurant in the area just in case. IF the bad reviews are real id leave and if they aren't stay and tell friend A that they're stupid and merrily go eat altogether. I can only make sure if I see the information with my own eyes and as Friend A did ghost the messages before id be more skeptical but not mad.
