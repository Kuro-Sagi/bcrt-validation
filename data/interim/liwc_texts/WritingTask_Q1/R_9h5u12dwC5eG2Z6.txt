The moment I read Friend A’s message, my first reaction is frustration. They ignored my texts a month ago when I asked for help with booking, and now—three hours before the dinner—they suddenly want to question the choice? That feels both inconsiderate and unhelpful. I want to tell them, “You could have raised this much earlier,” but I also know getting into an argument right now will not solve the problem. I remind myself that I chose this restaurant after reading several positive professional reviews from trusted food critics. One or two bad Google Reviews do not necessarily mean the place is unsafe; sometimes online reviews are exaggerated or even fake. Still, food safety is important, so I would quickly check recent official health inspection reports online and scan multiple review platforms to see if there’s a genuine pattern of complaints. Given the time constraints, the fact that I’ve paid a non-refundable deposit, and that the majority of sources praise the restaurant’s quality, I decide to keep the booking. I believe the information I originally trusted remains more reliable than a couple of negative online comments, especially on such short notice.
