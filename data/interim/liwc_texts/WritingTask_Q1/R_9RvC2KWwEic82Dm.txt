I would immediately feel very frustrated and angry regarding Friend A's response, accounting for the fact that they did not respond or acknowledge my previous message that I had sent. In this situation, I would be very emotional and stressed considering the lateness of the response. In response to Friend A, I would start by mentioning how they had not offered any input or assistance of any kind; however, I would then ask Friend A if they would have any ideas or alternatives. To determine which source of information is most trustworthy, I would compare the number of negative reviews with the more positive reviews to gauge which is more prevalent. I would also check the dates of said reviews, seeing if the food poisoning review is outdated, as the restaurant may have made improvements.
