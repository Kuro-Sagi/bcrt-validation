As soon as I saw Friend A’s message about the food poisoning reviews, my heart dropped a little. I was annoyed, honestly, not just because of the message, but because they didn’t help at all with the booking in the first place. Now, three hours before dinner, they suddenly raise concerns? I felt frustrated and stressed, especially since I’d already paid a non-refundable deposit. I’d probably text Friend A back with something like, “Hey, that’s concerning — but where was this energy a month ago when I asked for help booking? We’re kind of out of options now.” That may sound harsh, but it’s the truth, and we need to be practical. To figure out if the food poisoning claims are valid, I’d check the date and frequency of those negative reviews. Are they recent and consistent? Or just a one-off? I’d also check reliable food blogs or critic reviews again, especially since this place had great feedback from professionals. If possible, I’d call the restaurant to ask if they’re aware of any recent incidents. Given how last-minute this is, and the fact that most nearby places are full, I’d lean toward keeping the booking unless I find solid evidence that the issue is ongoing. It’s not ideal, but cancelling now with no backup would ruin Friend B’s birthday more than a small risk might. So, unless I uncover something serious, I’d stick with the original plan and go, but maybe avoid any raw seafood just in case.
