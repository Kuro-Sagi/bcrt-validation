i'd be annoyed and frustrated. why would you disagree the day of? why didn't you book somewhere you thought was better? why is it up to me to do? if you want to change the booking you need to find a better alternative, otherwise we're staying with this one. especially if i had paid non-refundable deposit, i wouldn't let the plans to be changed unless compensated. ask friend a why they only just said something. tell friend a that I've seen good reviews. I honestly at that point wouldn't care, i'd still go and just be cautious when im there. keep the booking
