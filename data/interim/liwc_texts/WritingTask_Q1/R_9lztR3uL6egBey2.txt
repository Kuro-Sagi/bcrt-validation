Firstly, as it is a serious and important thing which I expect my friend to act with. If they ignore my texts, it would make me mad and disappointed, but I would say regardless that he or she was being lazy or ignorant in this matter if it turned uglier. How I would decide if the information is trustworthy is I would ask others, or see well known reviews about the place. As Friend A was late in response his or her opinion would not matter to me. I would keep the booking regardless.
