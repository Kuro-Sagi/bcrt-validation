While I would be partially concerned by the content of the google reviews that friend A had sent, I would be more perturbed by the fact that friend A hadn't contributed to helping find a restaurant and only had criticisms about the restaurant I had to find by myself. Additionally, considering I had paid out of pocket a non-refundable deposit, and also that at them point of friend A messaging the criticisms it would be too late to rebook another venue, I would be further agitated. While I do see the merit in checking the restaurants public reviews as the restaurant may have gone above and beyond to please critics and impact their reviews, the reasons cited above would prevent me altering my choice of restaurant. In this scenario I would keep the booking due to the timing, the lack of input from Friend A and the out of pocket expense already incurred.
