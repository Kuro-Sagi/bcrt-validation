Wow. Seriously? Three hours before the dinner and now Friend A sends this? After ghosting me when I asked for help weeks ago? I’m honestly pretty pissed off. I’ve been stressing about this for a month, ended up booking it all myself, paid the non-refundable deposit — and suddenly they care? And about something they found on Google Reviews? It just feels a bit inconsiderate and honestly kind of cowardly to drop this so last minute. My first instinct is to snap back like, “Where was this energy when I needed help a month ago?” But I know that’s not helpful right now. I’d probably reply with something more composed like: “I saw that review too, but it’s one of like hundreds and most of them are great. It’s a bit too late to change now, but if you're really worried, feel free to sit this one out.” I’ll do a quick check anyway, just in case — scan the most recent reviews, see if that food poisoning comment is a one-off or part of a pattern. Maybe hop on the restaurant’s social media to see if they’ve posted anything weird recently. If anything seems seriously off, I’ll reconsider — but honestly, I trust the food critics more than some random angry Yelp user from two years ago. I’m keeping the booking. It’s too late to change plans, and the place still seems solid overall. It’s not perfect, but this is Friend B’s birthday, and I’m not going to let one panicked message ruin it. If Friend A doesn’t want to come, that’s on them.
