My immediate emotional reaction would be that my friend needs to consider the lengths I went to; e.g booking the restaurant and paying the non-refundable fee. I would kindly reply reassuring her that the restaurant has good reviews, and maybe send a screenshot of the majority reviews that show this. I would then say that I donâ€™t mind going elsewhere if they really are persistent on it. We would probably discuss back and forth our options, reviewing the restaurant together form multiple sources and forming our opinion. We would keep the plans, unless really heated argument arises and its non-negotiation from my friend.
