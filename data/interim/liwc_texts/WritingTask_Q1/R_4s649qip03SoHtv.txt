Hmm… when I saw the message from Friend A, my first reaction was a mix of frustration and helplessness. I had asked them for help a month ago, but they never replied. Now, just three hours before the dinner, they suddenly show up with a screenshot of some negative Google reviews and say, “Maybe we shouldn’t go...” It feels like they didn’t really care about this gathering or take any responsibility. I might reply to them first, saying something like: “It’s a bit late to bring this up now. I asked for your help earlier and didn’t get any response. I actually researched this restaurant—it has really great reviews from food critics.” I would try to stay calm though, because I don’t want this to affect the mood of the evening. After all, it’s for Friend B’s birthday. As for the screenshot, I wouldn’t fully trust one or two bad reviews. There are always people online who have bad experiences, but I prefer to look at the overall rating, the number of reviews, and expert opinions. I remember this restaurant being recommended by several food blogs and review platforms, and many people praised the service and food quality. To be extra sure, I’d quickly check a few more review sites—like TripAdvisor and Yelp—to see if there are any consistent complaints about food poisoning. If not, and things look generally positive, I’d decide to stick with the reservation. My final decision is to keep the original plan. Here’s why: It’s too close to dinner time, and most nearby restaurants are fully booked. This is Friend B’s birthday, and I don’t want to ruin it with last-minute changes. The restaurant has strong ratings and positive reviews from critics—one bad review isn’t enough to change my mind. I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit. I’ll arrive early to make sure everything is in order. If there’s anything unusual, I’ll handle it then. What matters most is that Friend B has a great birthday celebration.
