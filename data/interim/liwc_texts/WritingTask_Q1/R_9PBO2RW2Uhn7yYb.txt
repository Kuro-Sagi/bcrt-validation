Maybe I will say, “Thanks for letting me know — I’ll double-check. But most critic reviews have been really good, and I already secured the booking.” I’ll search the restaurant on official review platforms — Yelp, TripAdvisor, maybe even check local news — to see if there are any recent hygiene issues. I’ll also check their social media for any announcements. If I don’t see any consistent reports or official warnings, I’ll trust the critics and stick with the plan. Final choice: Keep the booking.
