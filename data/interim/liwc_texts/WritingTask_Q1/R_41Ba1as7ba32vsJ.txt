I would be pretty pissed off at him since if he wanted to have any input he probably should have said it early like a month earlier knowing my friend hes probably a bum so I know he didn't have anything urgent or anything to attend to. Unless he did though, for example his parents might have gotten into a car crash and died and so he couldn't respond, but still regardless of how traumatic this event was he should still have the decency to respond at least within a month, not just about this dinner but telling me about what happened to him as friends should do. So I'd probably tell him that if he wanted to change the booking he shouldve said something earlier and that me and friend B will be going to this place regardless of if A was coming or not. In regards to the reviews I'd probably think nothing of it as not only am I pissed of at A but you can find anyone saying anything on the internet, and so i would keep the booking.
