In the first place itself I asked for help so that we could decide on a restaurant that suits us all but Friend A did not respond to my texts which is pretty unethical and on top that they are texting me last minute to change the venue, if it were such a problem they should have spoken up sooner when they were clearly and respectfully given the chance. But now I have paid a non-refundable deposit so I would definitely not be keen on changing the venue.
