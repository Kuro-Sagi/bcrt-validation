Oh my GOD, are you kidding me right now?! Three hours before dinner and NOW you decide to chime in? I'm honestly so frustrated. Like, where were you a month ago when I actually NEEDED your help? I had to find this place by myself, put down my own money for the deposit, and now you're trying to sabotage it last minute with some random Google reviews? My first instinct is to text back something sarcastic like "Thanks for the 11th hour input" but I need to think this through for Friend B's sake. Okay, let me look at these screenshots properly. Google Reviews can be unreliable - anyone can post anything. These could be fake reviews or just people having bad experiences that aren't representative. The food critics I read had actual credentials and probably more rigorous standards. I'm going to quickly check if these reviews show up on other platforms like Yelp too. If there's a genuine food safety issue, it would probably appear across multiple sites, right? I should also see if these are recent reviews. But honestly, what are my realistic options here? It's three hours before dinner - most decent places will be booked solid for weekend service. And I'd lose my deposit. I am keeping the booking.
