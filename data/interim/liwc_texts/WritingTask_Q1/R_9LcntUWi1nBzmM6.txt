A. I'd be irritated, conscious as to whether they said that because they disliked me, were tired, or genuinely concerned about going to the restaurant. B. I would reassure them about the reviews and confirm they were sure about not going, assuring them it would be fine if not. C. Depends how long I have known that person for firstly, then I would choose if the reason was valid, in this case I would find it wasn't, then ask for clarification on there reasoning to get more insight into whether they were speaking the truth. D. Again would confirm with them their decision and ask if they would still want to go out that night, reassuring it would be ok if not. I would change plans if they were uncomfortable or unsure, otherwise I would reassure them about the food and keep the booking.
