You’ve been MIA for a whole month when I asked for help, and now, three hours before the dinner, you suddenly pop back up with bad reviews? And not even your own concerns — just screenshots. Where was this energy when we were trying to plan something for Friend B? I feel a bit of panic too — what if the reviews are legit? I don’t want to risk getting anyone sick, especially not Friend B on their birthday. But also… I booked this place, I paid the deposit, and I remember reading solid reviews from food critics. I trusted those more than random one-star complaints. I text Friend A back: “I appreciate the heads-up, but this is super last-minute. I read plenty of positive reviews, including critic ones. Did you find an alternative that isn’t fully booked?” I’m trying to stay civil, even though I’m seething. To double-check, I Google the restaurant again and look at multiple review sites — not just Google, but also TripAdvisor and maybe even Reddit or any recent local food blogs. I also check the dates on the bad reviews: were they clustered together? From years ago? If there’s a legit pattern of recent food poisoning, I’ll consider switching. If nothing looks alarming, I’m sticking with the booking. I won’t risk throwing the whole night into chaos based on one message three hours out. Worst case, I’ll give Friend B a heads-up when we get there and make sure everyone orders cautiously. But I’m not letting Friend A derail the whole plan without real evidence — especially when they bailed until now.
