Before replying, I need to cool my tone so I don’t come off too harsh. But I’d probably text back something like: “Hey, I get the concern but this is super last minute. I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit and most places are booked out tonight. Are you sure these reviews aren’t just outliers? The place has good critic reviews.” Next, I need to think practically. How do I know which reviews to trust? Food poisoning reviews can happen at any restaurant, even top ones. Sometimes people post exaggerated stuff when they’re mad. I should check if these complaints are recent and clustered together (which could mean a real problem), or if they’re random and months apart. If most reviews are still positive overall, that’s a sign the place is generally fine. I’ll quickly jump back onto Google and Yelp, maybe even look up their Instagram to see if any diners are posting stories today—do they seem happy? Also, I’ll search for any recent health inspection reports online. Usually if there’s a serious issue, it would show up there. Assuming I don’t find anything urgent or consistent, I’m leaning towards keeping the booking. We’re too close to the event to scramble for a new spot without stressing everyone, especially Friend B—it’s their birthday and the last thing I want is to ruin the night with chaos.
