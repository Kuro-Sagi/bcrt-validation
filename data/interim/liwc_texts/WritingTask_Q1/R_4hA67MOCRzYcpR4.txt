Upon reading Friend A's message, my immediate gut - reaction is one of annoyance. I mean, where were they when I was struggling to find a restaurant on my own after they ghosted me? Now, just three hours before the dinner, they pop up with this alarming news. Right away, I'd be tempted to text Friend A back saying, "You went radio - silent on me when I needed help, and now you come up with this? How reliable are these Google Reviews anyway?" I'm skeptical because I remember the restaurant has great reviews from professional food critics. Food critics usually have more in - depth knowledge and experience in evaluating restaurants compared to random diners on Google Reviews. To decide which information is trustworthy, I'd consider the source. Food critics are likely to have visited the restaurant, tasted the food properly, and made a more objective assessment. On the other hand, Google Reviews can be subjective, and it's possible that those who claimed to get food poisoning had other factors contributing to their illness. Before making a final decision, I'd do some extra checks. I'd try to find more recent reviews on other platforms like Yelp or TripAdvisor. I'd also look for any official health inspection reports of the restaurant. If I can't find any red flags from these additional sources, and considering that most nearby venues are full, I'd probably stick with the original booking. After all, I've already paid a non - refundable deposit, and the positive reviews from food critics give me some confidence in the restaurant's quality.
