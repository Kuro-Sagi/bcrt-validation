I would be pretty pissed, although I would have very likely to avoid non-refundable deposit for booking to beginning (I didn't know that this was a thing even). I would first text friend A asking why they would tell me such thing at the very last minute instead of helping, possibly some mild rage baiting and guilt tripping them. I most likely won't be able to decide whenever the information is trustworthy, as it's the internet and worse it's Google Reviews, literally anybody can write on there. I would most likely change plans to a less expensive restaurant (if this one was expensive) but maybe somewhere that I know is good and possible delay the birthday for a day or so. I would confirm it with friend B. In the case where they are busy or don't like the delay, I would change plans to maybe another area to celebrate the birthday.
