My immedaite emotional response would be anger and fustration as friend A did not contribute to help. I would tell Friend A it would be too late to find another venue and call him useless and how he would be no position to have a say. I would call him lazy and stupid for looking at food reviews and if he was so picky to go pick himself. I would not trust a food review that states food poisoning and trust a critic more.
