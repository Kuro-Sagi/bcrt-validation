i'll be angry. friend A has all his time to simply respond to my text. and now he's complaining that we should not go. i'll look at the reviews myself. if the food poisoning reviews are not even that bad, i might think this is just another excuse from friend A for not wanting to go. i don't think i can stop myself from thinking badly of A since he gave me a bad impression in the first place. however, if the reviews are actually that bad, i will follow up if the government-related kitchen checks gave that restaurant a visit. If they had, the restaurant is probably still safe to go. if they have not, i might not go and let friend A decide on a restaurant himself. if friend A does not reply to my message again, i'll book a restaurant for just me and friend B, excluding friend A. I don't think friend A and my friendship will ever stay the same again.
