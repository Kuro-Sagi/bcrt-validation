A. initially i felt annoyed/frustrated as friend a did not bother to help to begin with and is only mentioning something three hours before the booking when they could have said something earlier B. why did you not respond to my initial texts about the booking / why did you not mention this issue earlier C. determine if food critics were paid to go to the restaurant/leave a review or if they voluntarily went and left good reviews, see the google reviewers history (other ratings they have made) D. check if any other resturant, with better ratings, is available, give friend b options and ask what they would prefer My final choice is keep booking - deposit is non-refundable, friend b would probably feel disappointed if we were not able to get another booking, can avoid dishes that have higher risks of food poisoning/order drinks
