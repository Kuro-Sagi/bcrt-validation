I would be quite annoyed at friend A and would tell them they should've responded earlier or said something before I had booked the restaurant. I would still go to the restaurant though because it'd already been paid for and just kept the food poisoning information in mind (maybe chosen something that didn't have to be cooked). I'd leave the booking all to friend A the next time unless they specifically asked for my help with it all.
