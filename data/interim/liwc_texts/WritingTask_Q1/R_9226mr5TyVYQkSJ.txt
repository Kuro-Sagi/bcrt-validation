When I saw friend A’s message, I was shocked and a bit annoyed. Why is A sending this to me now, just three hours before dinner? They didn’t help at all when I was planning it! I replied to A and asked, “Where did you see this review? Is it recent? Just one person said they got food poisoning—was it serious?” I also checked Google Reviews myself. Most of them were very good. I even found some new reviews from this week that said the food was great. To be safe, I called the restaurant and asked if they had any recent issues with food safety. They told me everything was fine, and no one else complained. That made me feel more confident. Since I already paid a non-refundable deposit and there is no solid proof the restaurant is dangerous, I decided to stick with the plan. I trust the overall good reviews and the restaurant’s response. Changing now would be too late and too stressful.
