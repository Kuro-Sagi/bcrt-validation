A). I would feel a bit annoyed initially due to the lack of communication from friend A and last minute intervention. B). I would ask friend A if they have any alternatives in mind and if they would be willing to share the deposit fees in the case of cancelling of reservation. C). The source of the information is important. Restaurant critics, health inspectors and other governing bodies are more reliable sources than one off incidences of food poisoning. D). I would ensure there is a replacement available. Additionally, I would make sure that friend A is on board this time. As a final choice I would most likely stick with the booking. This is due to the high praise the restaurant has from critics and also the deposit that has already been put down. The few complaints towards the restaurant are common for any establishment and with the support the restaurant has it counters that.
