My first reaction was confusion,and I felt a little upset.I might say,where have u been these past few days "I couldn’t reach you.and now you’re telling me my choice is problem?then what exactly is your decision? I’ll do more research across platforms.if what him say turns out to be true,I’ll adjust my plan.but if not,I’m standing by it .because I don’t think I’m the one at fault.Him stayed silent for days ,so the decision I made during that time time should be respected.
