When I first saw Friend A’s message, my heart sank. After all the effort I put in to find and secure the booking—especially when they ghosted me during the planning—this was the last thing I needed. My gut reaction was frustration, but also concern, because food poisoning is serious. I’d reply to Friend A immediately: “That’s worrying—where did you find this review, and how recent is it?”

Before making a decision, I’d check the credibility of the reviews. Were they from verified diners? Were there multiple recent reports, or just an isolated case from months ago? I’d also cross-reference other review platforms and the restaurant’s official social media to see if they’ve addressed any complaints. If possible, I’d call the restaurant directly to ask about the alleged incident.

Given the short notice and the restaurant’s strong critic reviews, if I found the complaints were old or unverified, I’d keep the booking. But if the issue seemed current and genuine, I’d cancel—even if it meant losing the deposit—and quickly search for a backup venue, because everyone’s health is more important than money.
