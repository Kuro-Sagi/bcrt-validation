Reason

The credibility of information is weighed: The generally high praise from professional food critics weighs far more than a few unverified, anonymous Google negative reviews (especially those that have been "carefully" selected).
Urgency and feasibility: With only three hours left until dinner, it is almost impossible to guarantee finding a place of good quality and with a seat when changing locations at the last minute. The greater possibility is to cancel the entire celebration or end up in a worse restaurant.
Sunk cost consideration: That non-refundable deposit is no small amount. It feels so frustrating to lose this sum of money for nothing after friend A gave up.
The credibility of Friend A: His previous disappearance and lack of help, coupled with this sudden last-minute panic, make it hard for people to take his "warning" too seriously.
Risk mitigation measures: We will pay more attention at that time - order thoroughly cooked dishes, observe the atmosphere of the restaurant, and avoid the high-risk foods mentioned in the comments. If others seem suspicious, I will quietly remind everyone.
