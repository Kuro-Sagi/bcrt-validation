My immediate reaction is to just continue to the restaurant as the situation says that i havent found anything negative myself and that the friend hasnt been responding which indicates that they are not that close to me. I'd double check online to see if i can find anything negaitve about it and if not I'd just continue. This might be different if the friend is a really close when which if that was the case, I may consider cancellation but otherwise it makes most sense to just go as it is non refundable and in this specific situation, I myself have not found anything supporting his claims.
