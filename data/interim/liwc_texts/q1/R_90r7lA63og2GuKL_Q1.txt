Ugh… seriously? I just saw Friend A’s message, and my first reaction is frustration. Where was this energy when I asked for help a month ago? I’ve already paid the deposit, and now, three hours before dinner, they’re raising concerns based on a few random Google reviews?

I’d reply: “Hey, I get your concern, but it’s really last-minute. The place has glowing reviews from food critics, and we booked it because nothing else was available. Why bring this up now?” I’d definitely re-check the reviews — not just the negative ones, but the overall trend. Are the bad reviews recent or isolated? Are they even about the same location?

I’d also quickly search for any official health inspection notices about the restaurant. If there’s no formal warning or consistent red flags, I’d trust the critics and the majority of diners who had positive experiences. Friend A’s timing seems off, and I can’t ignore that they didn’t contribute when it mattered.

In the end, I’d stick with the booking. Changing now would cause chaos, we’d likely lose the money, and it’s too late to rebook somewhere good. I’d tell everyone to show up — and maybe just avoid the oysters.
