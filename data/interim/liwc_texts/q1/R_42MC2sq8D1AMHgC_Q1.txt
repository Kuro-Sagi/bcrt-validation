A. First I am a bit annoyed at the lack of his communication with me to his opposition to my idea that he had no contirbutino to. Iwonder why he stopped responding. 
B. I would encourage Friend A to stick to the plan, that food poisoning is not that huge of a deal (for me at lesat so it would be calm) 
C. Check if the said reviews are recent, but food poisoning can also happen in any place 
D. Do thing. 

My final choice is to stick to the plan becuase I have already made a non-refundable deposit, the birthday friend already knows where it is, and it will be highest convenience.
