When I first saw Friend A’s message, I felt frustrated and anxious. After all, they ignored my messages when I asked for help, and now, just three hours before dinner, they suddenly raise concerns. My immediate thought was, “Why now?” especially after I already paid a non-refundable deposit.

I would probably respond by saying, “I understand your concern, but I wish you had brought this up earlier. We’re very close to the dinner time, and it’s too late to make major changes.”

To decide whether to trust the reviews, I’d compare the dates of the negative and positive reviews. If the food poisoning claims are recent and repeated, that’s a red flag. But if they’re old or seem exaggerated, I’d trust the food critics and my original decision.

As an extra step, I might call the restaurant to ask if they’ve had recent complaints or check social media for any mentions.

In the end, I’d likely keep the booking. The restaurant has great reviews from reliable sources, and changing plans now would be too risky and stressful, especially since most other places are fully booked.
