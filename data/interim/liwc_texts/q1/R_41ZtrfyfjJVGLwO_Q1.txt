The first emotion i feel is annoyed. I am not annoyed at that they found bad reviews on the restaurant I chose because that is a valid finding, however, I am annoyed that they responded late and do not have an alternative option reserved. In saying so, I would ask then first why they didnâ€™t reply to me earlier. I want to understand their point of view and what they are going through before making any judgements about them. Then I would push us to both proceed us to find a new restaurant, but Iwnoukd ask them to pay half of the deposit that I set aside it is only fair.
