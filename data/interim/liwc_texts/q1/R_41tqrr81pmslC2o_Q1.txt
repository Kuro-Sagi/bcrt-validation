Ugh… seriously? Three hours before dinner and Friend A suddenly decides to bring this up? I’m honestly kind of annoyed that they completely ghosted me when I asked for help weeks ago, and now they want to chime in last minute? That’s frustrating and feels pretty unfair. I already paid a non-refundable deposit, and now this?

I’d probably respond to Friend A with something like, “Hey, I get your concern, but I really wish you’d brought this up earlier. The booking is set and I already paid for it.” I’d try not to sound too angry, but I’d definitely be honest.

Final choice: I’d keep the booking. The timing is too last-minute to make new plans, the deposit is gone either way, and I trust the professional reviews more than a few bad anecdotes. Plus, Friend B deserves a smooth and enjoyable birthday and stressing about this hours before won’t help anyone.
