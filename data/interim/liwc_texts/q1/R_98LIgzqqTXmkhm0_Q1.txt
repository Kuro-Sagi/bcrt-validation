Initial reaction would be frustration and disbelief. They did not help with the process of deciding which restaurant to book nor did they help in paying the deposit. They only check 3 hours before the dinner starts to say we shouldn't go without even offering an alternative. I'd view them as impulsive, reckless and quick to judge. 
I'd respond that it's too late to change, that if they had a problem they should've said so sooner. I'd mention that i had already paid for the deposit and point out not all reviews talk about food poisoning and point out my own reviews for the restaurant. Regardless, i would listen to their worries about food poisoning and do some quick research on the reviews. What the customers who got food poisoning ordered so maybe we could avoid ordering the same. The frequency of food poisoning reviews and check reviews from other websites other than google to see if it's the same.
That would help in the accuracy of the overall review of the restaurant, to see which is trustworthy.
Overall, i would still stick with keeping the booking. I have paid for the deposit and i trust in my own research pointing the restaurant to be good. I am not someone who would cancel hours before.
