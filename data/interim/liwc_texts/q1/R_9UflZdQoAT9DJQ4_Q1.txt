I would feel disappointed, but I would take action and start looking at restaurants, making a booking for us. I'd then let the whole group know that I made an appointment, but also text Friend A individually to let them know that they didn't need to spend time anymore searching. I'd look for a cuisine that the birthday person enjoyed, and address any allergies within the group. I would change the plans since I am nervous about the previous reviews involving food poisoning and would choose to make new plans over the risk of getting food poisoning.
