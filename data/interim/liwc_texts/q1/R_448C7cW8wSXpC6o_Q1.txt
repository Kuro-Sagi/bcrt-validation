Bro are u serious they've only just gotten back to me why they doing this so bloody late actually incompetent who doesn't know how to answer their phone one time 

hi friend A, it's too late to book a new venue, most are full, i reckon we risk it for the biscuit n pray we don't get food poisoning, maybe we just wont order anything high risk 

i would go through the reviews which show which meals could've possibly led to the food poisoning and avoid them 

i would keep the booking because it's way too late to find a new venue and if food critics say it's good i will trust that
