A. Anger and frustration towards the friend.  Not only that they left when it was time to actually help and make a deposit but also that they are looking at negative reviews to be contrarian. 

B. I am not as confrontational as I should be but I would definitely go ahead with the booking and brush him/her off. 

C. I wouldn't deny that some people got food poisoning but if it is a popular restaurant with thousands dining a week and there was an occasion or 2 where people got food poisoning, it wouldn't bother me. 

D. Nope. The deposit has been paid so we will go ahead with it.

We would keep the booking because the deposit has been paid, if the friend didn't leave before then he could have helped make the decision but they did leave therefore it is not up to them at this point.
