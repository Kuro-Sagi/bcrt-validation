First of all, I will be very unhappy and angry. And I will say to friend A: Why didn't you reply when I was communicating with you? Now that I'm running over here, you're saying that my choice is flawed. If you are not satisfied, you should have communicated with me a month ago instead of now. Secondly, I think although the screenshot of Google's comments has some persuasive power, since I'm not sure about the intentions of friend A, I will check for myself to see if these things actually happened. Personally, I think it might have happened before, but not recently. Finally, my final decision is that if I confirm that there has been a poisoning incident recently, I will go to the merchant to discuss the matter and refund the fee for the reserved position. If no such event has occurred recently, I would choose to keep the reservation. Even if they don't come, I will still go and eat by myself.
