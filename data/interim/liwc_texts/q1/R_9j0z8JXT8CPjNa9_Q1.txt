Upon reading the abrupt message, I am disappointed and frustrated that Friend A decided to share their concerns with me so late. I would tell Friend A that the restaurant I have reserved is non-refundable and that they should have mentioned their concerns to me sooner. I would double-check on Google and online through the possible reviews Friend A may have seen, and whether the opposing information supports their claims about food poisoning. If I deem it necessary, I would cancel the booking and find a different restaurant to celebrate the birthday.
