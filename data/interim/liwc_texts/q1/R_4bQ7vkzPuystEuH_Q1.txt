When I received that last-minute message from friend A—just three hours before dinner—I was shocked and frustrated. A month ago, when I asked for help to book a restaurant for friend B’s birthday, they completely ignored my texts. So I made the reservation myself, even paid a non-refundable deposit. Now, suddenly, they show up with a screenshot of a negative Google review claiming someone got food poisoning?

At first, I panicked. But then I reminded myself why I chose this restaurant in the first place. It had amazing reviews from trusted food critics, a high rating overall, and a strong reputation. I decided to investigate further before reacting. I called the restaurant to ask if they had received any recent complaints—they hadn’t. I also looked up the restaurant’s health inspection record and found no issues.

After weighing the facts, I decided to stick with my original plan. One anonymous review wasn’t enough to change everything last minute. I’ll monitor the situation closely, but I’m confident in the choice I made.
