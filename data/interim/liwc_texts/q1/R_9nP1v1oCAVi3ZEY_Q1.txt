I'm feeling annoyed that friend A is criticising the restaurant I picked when they didn't try and find an alternative, and especially because they are bringing this up so last minute. 
I would probably look at the Google reviews myself and see how many and how recent the reviews are that friend A screenshotted. If there were many other similar reviews, I'd probably start looking for an alternative. If there were many reviews, but most were positive and there were very few other similar negative reviews, I would want to still go to the restaurant I picked. I would probably rely on the volume of reviews more than the source, but if there were not many reviews overall, I would weight the food critics reviews as more trustworthy than some random google reviewers.
If I decided to start looking for alternatives, I would message friend A straight away saying sure, we can look for a new place, and ask them if they had any ideas? Then I would find and book somewhere new. I'd message friend A later, probably the next day, explaining that I had to pay a deposit for the first restaurant, and ask if they would agree to pay a portion of the lost deposit. In that message I would also tell them that I was feeling frustrated that they didn't help me find a restaurant in the first place, and I was upset that they assumed I would take on the mental load of organising the dinner for our shared friend.
My choice to keep the booking or change restaurant would be based on the other reviews on google etc that I had read today. I would feel inclined to keep the booking, almost out of spite that friend A didn't help to begin with, but also because I want to trust my research of good restaurants and I believe I'm pretty good at discerning these things.
