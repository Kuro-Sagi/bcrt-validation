I would be a little angry at first because nobody got any ideas but only me do the reservation but when we were about to have the meal "Friend A" appeared and that 
was quite annoying.But it was understandable because he just said his thoughts though that was too late.

I would say why couldn't told me earlier because I had paid the money already.
And to be honest I wouldn't pay much attention to whether the info is true or fake.It's
a waste of time and what was more important was to satisfy everyone.I think i would not just insist what I chose but instead, have a discussion with them to choose a more satisfying plan , even if it meant I have to afford finance loss.But I probably unwilling to have a next meal with them in the future.
