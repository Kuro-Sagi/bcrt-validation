I would be quite annoyed that friend A replied so late, and I'll wonder if it was intentional or not. I will ask friend A why she/he didn't reply to my messages before. It wouldn't be a confrontation since I know both will be attending friend B's birthday dinner, and I wouldn't want to risk tension between us, which may ruin the dinner. I'll confront friend B about it in a light-hearted manner, and depending on the truthfulness and apologeticness from his/her response, I'll consider whether I still want to remain close friends with them, or whether it's a stain on their character from my pov.

Afterwards, I'll definitely go check the Google reviews myself to confirm if friend A's information is trustworthy or not. After I get my answers, I'll either refute or agree with friend A, and if the information is as she says, I will change plans, and if it isn't, I'll keep the booking.

Just to add, realistically, we would tell friend B the plans a few days prior, just to see if she/he approves, as it is friend B's birthday, and it will also inform him/her of prior travel plans.
