It reminds me of an old friend of mine who lacked communication and then believed we could all work around them when they talked to us last minutes so I would be very frustrated at them for not talking sooner and overstepping when I was the one who put in the effort to find a place. I feel like there would be more of a reason behind their decision of not wanting to go to this restaurant so I would let them know that I chose the restaurant because of good food critic reviews and rather than starting an argument, ask if there is any other reasons they don't want to go to this restaurant and remind them it is too late to move after the deposit and the late notice, if they would like to change restaurant's I would expect the deposit to be split between us and for them to find and book the restaurant by themself for us all as I wouldn't want to put in the same effort again.
