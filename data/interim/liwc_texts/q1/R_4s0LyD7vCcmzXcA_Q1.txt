When I read the message of Friend A, I felt depressed because no one helped to complete the plan before the birthday, and no one returned any messages to me. Near the beginning of the activity, they showed up and disrupted my plan. I might ask Friend A: Why didn't you reply to my messages before and agree to these decisions? Because I have been disappointed with them. I will check the user name and comment release date to confirm the authenticity of these messages.
