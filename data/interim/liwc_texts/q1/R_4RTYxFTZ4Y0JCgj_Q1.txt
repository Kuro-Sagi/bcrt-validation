A= my immediate emotional reaction was annoyance. I think they only said that because they didn't like the choice.
B= "Surely if there was actual food poisoning there would be some evidence of it"
C= I'd decide the information was trustworthy based on how recent the "incident" was and if all the reviews were posted at the same time.
D= I would check to see if the review was vague or not.
I would keep the booking because the timing is too convenient and we have already paid a non-refundable deposit.
