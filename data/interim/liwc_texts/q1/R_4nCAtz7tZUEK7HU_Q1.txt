My immediate reaction would be one of annoyance or irritation, as if friend A helped me one month ago like he was supposed to, we would've had this issue arise earlier where it wouldn't be a big deal. Although I appreciate the gesture to help, it comes too late and also undermines the work I've done to organise this, which friend A was also supposed to help with as well. I would first check how frequently this food poisoning scenario occurred, and if it was just a one off or two time thing I would disregard it and favour the word of the food critics, as I perceive this to be more reliable. To friend A, I wouldn't complain or vocalise my thoughts directly to them, unless this was a problem which has repeatedly occurred or something I've had an issue with for a long time. I may complain about it to one of my closer friends later.
