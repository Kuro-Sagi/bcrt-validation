I already paid the deposit, why is A telling me just now, why didn't A respond to my messages earlier when I needed them to? And A is just telling me now? That is not going to help the situation at all. So now if we actually don't go, either A and me split the deposit price and we go to a new place or we just go to the place I picked. But food poisoning is dangerous and the reviews food critics gave might have been biased. It's quite risky. I also should've checked the Google Reviews before I booked. That's my mistake. Maybe we should also consult B and see what they say. But I am still annoyed at why A stopped replying and is only saying all of this now. Where was A when I needed them? Final choice is to change plans because it is B's birthday and it is not worth it the risk.
