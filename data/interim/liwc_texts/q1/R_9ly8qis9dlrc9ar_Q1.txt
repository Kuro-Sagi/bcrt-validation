My initial reaction was a mix of disappointment and frustration. You’d think that at our ages we’re capable of making a simple reservation for a friend, which makes me think of 4 main possibilities, friend A either doesn’t like friend B due to some reason, possibly experiencing something in their home life or other aspect, could possibly be trying to avoid responsibility, knowing that I’ll make the booking anyways, or possibly struggles to help and communicate as a team? Their observation about the food poisoning was a good catch, but at this point in time there’s nothing to be done, and focussing on a useless solution doesn’t help. Instead of maybe we shouldn’t go… they could’ve suggested something like “let’s not try the fish” or smth more helpful. At this point I would stick with the original booking, but look further into the food poisoning case, hopefully trying to avoid the possibility of us having the same outcome. I’d also express to friend A and ask them if something was going on. I’d also express how I felt abandoned and disappointed that all the responsibility was thrown onto me, and point out that the last minute comment was possibly phrased poorly.
