I'm immediately very frustrated and annoyed with friend A because they didn't help find the restaurant when they were supposed to and were rude enough to not respond to my messages, so they don't get to change the plans or have an opinion at this late stage. I'd say "well, I've already paid the deposit and the reviews I've read are all glowing so we should still go, unless you'd be happy to reimburse me for the deposit". Google reviews are anonymous so they're much less likely to be legit, while food critics are likely to be honest as they have a reputation to uphold to sustain their career. I would check all of the other google reviews before proceeding to see if any of them mention food poisoning. I would keep the booking as risk of food poisoning is low and probably was a one-off for that person who posted the google review, plus I don't want to lose my deposit money.
