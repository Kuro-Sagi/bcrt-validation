I don't care actually there's only 3 hours left and no way I'm changing the restaurant. To friend A why at this point u showed me this? Like where were u when I needed your help you were not even there. I don't even beileve what friend A said maybe they are trying to drag me down. I will show up to the restaurant at the booking time will still order and celebrate the birthday. If i chose that restaurant, that means it's good enough and have confidence in myself. I don't care about friend A like why would they showed up at last minute and judged my decision. Since it is non-refundable we will show up and eat , and if food poisoning happen we can sue the restaurant. The food critics are more trustworthy than someone who showed uo and judge my decision at the last minute. Keep the booking because there's only 3 hours left and I'm confident with my decision.
