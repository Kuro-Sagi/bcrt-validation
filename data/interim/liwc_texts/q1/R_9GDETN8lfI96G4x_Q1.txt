Why did you disappear when we were supposed to work on this together? And now, after I handled everything on my own, you suddenly show up—just to criticize my choice? Honestly, I’m frustrated. I spent time researching, made the reservation, and even paid a non-refundable deposit. Now, with just three hours to go, you send me screenshots about food poisoning? Of course, no restaurant wants something like that to happen—it must’ve been an isolated case. The critics loved this place. And let’s be real: it’s Friday evening, most places are already full. What exactly do you expect me to do now? Cancel everything based on a few bad reviews, risk losing the deposit, and scramble to find a new spot last-minute? It feels like you’re not even considering how much effort I’ve put in. At this point, I’m leaning toward keeping the booking. Unless something really urgent comes up, we’re going.
