I would be very angry, firstly, I picked the venue and paid for it. Further, not replying to someone's message is rude in my opinion, and I am booking the restaurant for them. I would probably say to my friend A, Please pick a restaurant yourself. I would read the reviews of the restaurant again. If there is only one review, then it should be a chance event; if there are more than three of this kind of review, then I think I would consider it. Also, if there is other software, I would check the reviews. Before making a final decision, I would ask my friend B's opinion, as it's his birthday, if he wants to be at this restaurant, he doesn't have to make a change, if he wants a different one, let him choose. After the discussion with B, I will decide whether to keep the booking or change the plan, and if I do change the plan, I will most likely leave them to their own choices and booking.
