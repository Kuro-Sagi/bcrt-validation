I feel really angry, because A didn't respond my message when we had to find and choose a restaurant. I made all staffs by myself and paid the deposit, but A told me we shouldn't go 3 hours before the booking time.

I will say to A: why don't you tell me this when I ask for your opinion? yes, I also think we shouldn't go after I read your message, but I already paid the deposit and it un-refundable. what do you think we should do now???

I decide trust A's information, because I don't want take we into a risks.

I'll change plans, but I'll ask A to make a new plan and tell B what's happened.
