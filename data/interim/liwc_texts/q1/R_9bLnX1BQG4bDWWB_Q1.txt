Immediately, my gut reaction, and honestly anyone's initial reaction would be despair. To have been given a whole month to complete such an otherwise simple task, only to not fulfil it, would be incredily disappointing. Shamful even. The first thing I would say to friend A is to sit them right down and investigate why they had left you hanging for weeks on end. Though it mightn't be the best use of time, I feel that it would at least dispel some of the built up tension. After we've discussed the elephant in the room, we would then figure out whose sources are more trustworthy, by simply considering the reliability of our food critics, and their google reviews. Hopefully, there should be enough of a sample size for one of the two to deduce an objective answer. If the worst case scenario transpires i.e. food poisoning seems to run rampant, we'd have to give one last ditch attempt at finding another restaurant. I personally do not think calling off the event would be viable, depending on the number of attendees, as it would be very abrupt for the most trivial of reasons. If no restaurant is available, we might just have to go through with the current one and hope for the best, giving a large disclaimer to all attendees that they might risk getting sick idk
