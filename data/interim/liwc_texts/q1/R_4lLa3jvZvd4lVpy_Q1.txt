Should probably avoid restaurants with cases of food poisoning. Although, being a very good restaurant with good critic reviews, the chances of it happening again are low and the non-refundable deposit has already been paid. I would tell this to Friend A. The news source could also be untrustworthy. Keep booking for these reasons.
