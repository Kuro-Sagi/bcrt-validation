My immediate reaction is annoyance. They should have helped or looked at reviews earlier if they wanted a say in where to go. 
To explain our situation, I'd lead with the fact that it's too late to change the restaurant anyway, and if we didn't go, we wouldn't have a nice restaurant to go to. Then I'd explain the great reviews from the food critics. 
While food critics are usually more reliable than online reviews, I acknowledge that there may be biases. Restaurants usually treat food critics much nicer than regular guests. Online reviews may be more authentic, but people can easily lie due to any personal vendettas or even just for no reason at all. 
Since bad reviews are usually guaranteed regardless of how nice an establishment is, I'd consider the ratio of good to bad online reviews. Perhaps I'd try to look for the restaurant's food safety certificate and see how recent it was attained or how renewed. I'd consider the price of the non-refundable deposit as well as the general reputation of the restaurant.
Assuming there aren't any apparent red flags, I would keep the booking. The deposit is paid and changing plans so soon is a hassle. 
Assuming there aren't any significantly apparent red flags, I will keep the booking. e
