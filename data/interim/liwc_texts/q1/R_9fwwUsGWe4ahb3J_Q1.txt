Immediately I felt annoyed and upset by the thought of losing my deposit and seeing my friend. I think I would mention the fact that I paid a non-refundable deposit and also mention the time and that we would have limited options to eat dinner elsewhere. Food critics typically are trustworthy due to their image and followers which respect their decisions. Google reviews are easily fabricated and are often non-truthful or are plagued by overly critical middle-aged individuals. I would investigate the google reviews to see when they were posted as well as the date of the last food critic review to check the recency of the 'food poisoning' claims. Ultimately due to the late notice, lack of input from Friend A and the abundance of good reviews from critics, I would keep and attend the pre-decided reservation.
