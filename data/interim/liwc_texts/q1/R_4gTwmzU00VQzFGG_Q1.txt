I would feel frustrated. I needed support moths ago when i was originally booking. It is nice that they want tohelp but frankly this timing is just undermining the original plan, showing little trust in my planning and the persons actions are not supportive as they didnt provide an alternative option. I would respect the input a bit more if it seemed like they were genuinely trying to help and provideconstructive feedback not doubt. I would tell them that iu appreciate their concern and hear them however i did do my own research and have seen lots of positive feedback from trusted food critiques, i would essentially try to reassure them of my choice and suggest that we just give the place a try and if we really catch a bad vibe we can pivot then, especially given the timing. I would trust my research as i am sure i would have looked into many places and chosen the one i trust and think looks best.
