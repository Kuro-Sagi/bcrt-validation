I would still want to go like only a couple of bad reviews compared to the food critics and I think its fair if they haven't messaged me in a while. I would say to friend A that we are still going there and that is finally as it is booked and they have not messaged me in like forever. I choice the critics over my friend because I doubt my friend is a food critic and this is just some google review which I couldn't care less about them. The only extra action I would take before choosing is asking where to go instead and checking with google reviews to see to show that everywhere has bad reviews. My final choice is to go to the place that I have already booked and friend A has to suck it up as it is for a birthday for not him.
