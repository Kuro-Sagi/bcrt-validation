I would think that the behavior of friend A is not very good. When I made a reservation at a restaurant and paid the non-refundable reservation deposit, friend A didn't reply to me. Instead, three hours before the dinner, he told me that the restaurant I chose had a bad rating because some diners had food poisoning. This made me think that he was deliberately picking a fight with me. I would say to friend A, "Then why didn't you tell me earlier? I had already paid the non-refundable deposit to this restaurant a month ago, and why did you only point out the problems with this restaurant on B's birthday? Since you didn't spend your money, weren't you concerned about this matter for the entire month?" I would temporarily believe the food poisoning phenomenon that friend A mentioned and suspect that the food critics had fabricated the evaluation of this restaurant. Then I would go and check the Google reviews of this restaurant by myself. If the food poisoning was true, I would change my plan and cook a dinner for friend B to celebrate his birthday. If it was fake, I would keep the reservation and from now on, I won't have any contact with friend A.
