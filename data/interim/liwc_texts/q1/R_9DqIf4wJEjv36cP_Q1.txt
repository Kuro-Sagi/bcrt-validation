I would firstly be surprised that the the restaurant would have such poor experiences, especially upon remembering the high acclimations from critics. I would tell Friend A that its probably just once off situations, and that we should try it ourselves considering our limited options. I would choose to keep our booking and go to the restaurant. In addition, other restaurants would probably be fully booked or have no space for us on such short notice, so unless there was another option for eating then the initial restaurant is our only option. I would also maybe conduct my own research on the reviews, in ortder to verify legitimacy
