A. Uhmm, what the heck. My gut says to just try the restaurant because all the other restaurants are full and it's too late, and if the food is bad atleast there is memories from it. It's kind of upsetting that they didn't respond until 3 hours before the dinner. Very frustrating to have been put in this situation

B. Hey, sorry for booking the dinner but I think it might be too late to cancel/refund, because there is a non-refundable deposit and just because there is a few bad reviews doesn't mean its entirely bad, because I've seen some good reviews too. Maybe we can try out the good dishes they reccomend and if its absolutely ridiculous we can always go out again another time or go to another place

C. Both seem reasonable, but cross referencing which dishes, time thhe reviews were posted and authenticity of the food credits will also count. 

D. Hmm, discuss a little bit with friend B what they would want to do aswell cause realistically their birthday aswell.

Keep the booking, but be wary with what we choose, maybe avoiding the said  "bad dishes" and trying out the "good ones" and seeing if it's really reflecting the critics.
