That any place may a food poisoning problem on a random night, and since other places are booked we might as well eat there. I'd say to friend a to not worry and to bring the review as a screenshot to the restaurant.I'd message or call any people I personally know who have eaten at the restaurant for real reviews. I would keep the booking as any place may make a mistake leading to food poisoning, personally I'd eat a steak and ask them to be sure its cooked to my liking, showing them the review and maybe even speaking to the manager on shift before ordering to let them know of the issue in hand.
