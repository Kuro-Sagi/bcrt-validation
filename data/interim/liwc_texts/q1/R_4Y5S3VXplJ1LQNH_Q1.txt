I would be annoyed, and ask friend A to think about the larger number of food crtics that have positively rated the restaurant so it will likely be fine. I would also express frustration at friend A and ask them how they expect us to make plans when they ignored my messages for a month. I would also explain that theres a non-refundable deposit that was paid and that i would much prefer to keep the current reservation. If friend A is extremely reluctant, i would cancel plans entirely if they responded in a defensive manner when i called them out about their bad reply game and inconsideration for me and ask Friend A to pay half of the deposit. If friend A was understanding of my frustration, i would be happy to find somewhere else to go, but would also ask for half of the deposit. My first preference would be to keep the original reservation.
