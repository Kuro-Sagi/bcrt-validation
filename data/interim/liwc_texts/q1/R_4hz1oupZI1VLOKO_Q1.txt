a. My immediate emotional reaction is of annoyance, since Friend A didn't bother to even help me pick the restaurant, let me send a deposit, and *then* sent me the Google reviews. If Friend A was too busy, that's one thing, but there was no communication.
b. I'd say "I appreciate the warning but I really think you should have helped me with this earlier. I wasn't aware of the reviews and now I have a non-refundable deposit, a money hole. Please help me find another place, although it's such short notice."
c. I'd trust the negative reviews more. Food critics would be more likely to receive good food, since they were specifically writing reviews on it, and regular customers would be a better metric for the overall quality of the restaurant.
d. I'd tell Friend A that we should split for a different restaurant (change plans), and then find another one in the area for Friend B.
