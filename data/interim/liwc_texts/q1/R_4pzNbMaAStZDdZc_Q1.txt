I would definitely be frustrated receiving the message from Friend A. I think I would have to step back for a second before replying to make sure I didn’t say anything I would regret. Considering how late it is, I would guess that the deposit would be lost by this point, and therefore I would be losing that money if we didn’t go to the restaurant. It’s difficult to say whether or not the food critics or the google reviews are more trustworthy, so I think I would ignore the reviews entirely considering it’s so last minute. Ultimately, I think I would tell Friend A that we should keep the booking. I would tell them that if they wanted to have a look around for another restaurant then they were more than welcome, but they would have to help me pay for the deposit for the other restaurant. At the end of the day its most important that Friend B enjoys their birthday, but I would make it clear that I should not be paying for the last minute change of plans alone. If Friend A did not want to pay for the deposit, I would reiterate that we should then keep the booking.
