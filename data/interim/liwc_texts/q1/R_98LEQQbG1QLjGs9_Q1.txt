The immediate reaction is annoyance/frustration, because Friend A didn't help me book the restaurant and it's my money he will waste by not showing up. First I'd ask him why he didn't respond to my texts initially, and I'd want a decent reason for that. I'd tell Friend A that we'd better go regardless of reviews as I've already paid and it's non-refundable. If he still doesn't want to show up, I'd ask him to pay me back half the amount. Deciding which information is trustworthy and which checks/actions to take is a little more difficult. I'd need to see whether the poisoning incidents were isolated to a certain period, whether or not the restaurant had responded to them, and I'd figure out which dishes the victims ordered and make a note not to get them myself. I'd also need to look at when the critic reviews were posted and the content within them, which dishes they rate highly etc. I'd tell Friend A that we could order based on this information.
