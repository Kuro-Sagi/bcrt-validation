1. should have told me your opinion earlier 
2. reassure them that there were also great reviews
3. information straight from the sources, I consider the frequency of negative experiences, however if good reviews outweigh the bad significantly I stick to the good 
4. should thoroughly check reviews and the other person's opinion prior to making the reservation
