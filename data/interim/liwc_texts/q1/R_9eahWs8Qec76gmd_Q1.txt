When I read Friend A’s message, I felt extremely annoyed and angry. I couldn’t believe they waited until three hours before dinner to bring this up, especially after completely ignoring me when I asked for help weeks ago. If they were so concerned about food safety, why didn’t they say something earlier or better yet, book the restaurant themselves? I would reply right away with something like, “Seriously? You had one job, and you ghosted me when I needed help. Now that I’ve done everything, suddenly you care? If you’re so worried, feel free to find another place yourself. I’m not doing it again.” To be sure, I would contact the restaurant to check if there were any recent food safety complaints. I’d also look at the reviews carefully when were the food poisoning claims posted? Are they verified or just random angry customers? In the end, I would keep the booking. It’s too late to change anything, the deposit is non-refundable, and I already took responsibility when A didn’t. If they don’t want to come, that’s their choice but I’m done handling things for them.
