I would feel very frustrated as to have last minute change, especially if they had not given a helping hand prior to making the decision. I'd respond to their text message, letting them know that if they want to change the booking, they are free to but I personally would like to continue on with the plan as it is hard to find a different restaurant so quickly. I would take into consideration the reviews about food poisoning and suggest that we simply avoid ordering specific dishes. The final decision would be for me to keep the reservation or ask Friend B for their opinion on the matter. If they are indifferent, it would be up to Friend A to cancel the booking and find a new restaurant themselves. Otherwise, the reservation will stay and proceed.
