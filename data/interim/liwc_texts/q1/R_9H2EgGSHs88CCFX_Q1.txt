a) immediate gut reaction is upset, disappointed and nervous 
b) i would say that its up to them to show up or not but they must pay me back for the deposit if they don't show and that i'm upset with the lack of communication we had 
c) i would have checked the review for myself to actually see if it was credible or an excuse my friend had made,
d) see if there is anything like that restaurant as an alternative 

final choice would have been to stick to the restaurant and not change plans
