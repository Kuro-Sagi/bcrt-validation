a) annoyance
b) i would say sorry i paid a non refundable deposit so we cant really change up, ask them to look into places for dessert that we could go afterwards and what food people were getting sick from to be safe we could avoid that on the menu.
c) i would trust my initial information, critics are professionals i would trust them over a hand few reviews from customers who very likely could be sick from something else they ate or other unrelated reaons.
d) check what food was making people sick and not order it, look into other reviews from those people to see if they frequently leave poor reviews.

my final choice is same as my answer to b
