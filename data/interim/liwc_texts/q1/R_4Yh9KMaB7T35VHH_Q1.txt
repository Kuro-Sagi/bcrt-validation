well why didn't they tell me right away? they just stopped responding and we had a month to decide this. i'd be quite upset.
what's A's reason for doing that?? do they not actually want to go, do they want to pin it all on me so they can blame me if something's wrong? are they trying to ruin B's special day?

id say "why are you telling me this now?? we can't go anywhere else and my research showed its a good place. im sorry man but unless you can find somewhere else or come up with an alternative somehow then we're going there. you dont have to come if you dont want to lol"

i'd also check the google review accounts to see if they were recently created, their history etc. wow im a little paranoid. basically if i found that they were created only for this i would just go with B and ignore what A said, if they come they can come but i'll talk to them privately afterward and tell B about it sometime
