My immediate gut reaction was mostly like an "are you serious" response. I definitely though of how is friend A and actual friend of B. I would defintely say to friend A that "whats wrong with the restuarant? Just because one google reviever says that they got food poisoning, doesn't mean that the restaurant is bad. You didn't even respond to my texts, nor you didn't even help me out with finding a place ofr friend B"

I decided that the great reviews from food critics is more trustworhty than friend A, as they also only had one screenshot, versus many reviews from food critics.

I would check the reviews of the restuarant again, and I would keep the booking as Friend A's argument is not valid to prove that we shouldn't go to that place. Furthermore, I want to be considerate fo Friend B as it is their birthday.
