i would be immediately pressed at friend A and text/speak to them passive aggressively asking why she couldn't have been so avidly researching before i made the deposit. considering that she is evidently not a trustworthy friend, she is likely an equally untrustworthy source and so i would confirm these food poisoning allegations myself. if they were true and from multiple sources/reviews, i would then ask her what she wants to do about the non-refundable deposit, heavily implying that i will not be paying for it entirely, actually this would depend on how hefty the deposit was.

scenario a (hefty deposit): if she is kind enough to take on some of deposit then i would be happy to switch restaurants if there was one to her liking, otherwise i would snitch to any other friends involved/invited and probably keep the booking out of spite. 

scenario b (smaller deposit): i would be a kind gracious friend and start looking for restaurants with less health risks, hopefully find one and switch the booking
