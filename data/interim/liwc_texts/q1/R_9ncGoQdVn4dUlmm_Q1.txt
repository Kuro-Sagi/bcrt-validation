Why would you ask this now after I have already booked the restaurant. Like imagine ghosting me for weeks and then saying or well implying that they don't want to eat here cause of what food safety. I can't even make a refund and I'm stressed as it is. Like you didn't even pay or split a deposit for the booking and that irritates me the most. I just assumed that we were busy or making a better plan but all I got was silence. Like I did everything out of my own heart and now you are trying to make me feel guilty. This is so last-minute and it didn't have to be if you could've just contributed even a little. Despite that, the warning about food poisoning does concern me. It might just be those unlucky people, I'll check for any health inspection history as well as how recent those google revies are. I might as well call the restaurant just to be safe and politely ask if there were recent complaints. But honestly the reviews I found from those legit critics wash out the negativity. I rather trust them then some anonymous user. At the end of the day, I want to celebrate Friend B's  so I'd honestly keep the booking to save the money I spent.
