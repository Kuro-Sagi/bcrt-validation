I would feel immediately irritated from the message, and honestly from the moment that they ghosted me. Because if we were supposed to plan this birthday together and they weren't helping (in this scenario, completely ghosted me) I would be really pissed since they are putting in zero effort. 

After I read the message, I would be severely irked but I would still reply cause at least they're putting in effort now... I would read the reviews that she sent and also, if I selected this restaurant it would have been because the reviews are positive and ive seen good stuff so I would tell her the other positive reviews. 

I would wait to see if she replies to these messages and see what she has to say. 

But I think I would still keep the booking, because non refundable, and if we all went and the vibe of the restaurant and the food isn't that good then I would suggest that we go to a bar or somewhere else.
