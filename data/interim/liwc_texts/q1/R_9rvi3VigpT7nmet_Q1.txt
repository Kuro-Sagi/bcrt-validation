Would be annoyed that he has having opinions but not contributing when booking the restaurant. will just ignore him because he was not the one who paid the non refundable deposit. i will trust the positive reviews that i saw myself to make sure friend B is satisfied on his birthday. ultimately i will just keep the booking to not lose money on the deposit and because i believe the restaurant is good.
