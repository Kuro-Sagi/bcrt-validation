A. I would be quite exasperated as they could have contacted me about their concerns before I invested a non-refundable deposit into the restaurant. And there is almost no time left to book a restaurant anyways.

B. I'd tell him or her that it would be too late to change the decision. I would advise them to not order or eat any raw food in case they were especially concerned about food poisoning.

C. In my opinion the Google Reviews can be easily fabricated, however it is also true that if a known food critic is eating at a restaurant, then the food they receive may often be prepared with greater care. Nevertheless I would say that the Google Reviews is by far the less reliable source here.

D. I would also call up the restaurant and enquire about the reviews, or enquire about the dishes that may cause gastrointestinal incontinence.

I would still keep the booking. I already paid a non-refundable booking, all the other venues are nearly full and Friend A had a lot of time to contact me about restaurant concerns. I also don't fully trust the authenticity of the concerns.
