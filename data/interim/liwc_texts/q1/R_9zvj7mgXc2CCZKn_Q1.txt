I would be resentful towards Friend A and argued for reasons they left me unread. I would say, "Not my problem, already paid for it. You don't have to come if you have such low tolerance," to Friend A. I would prefer not to listen to what the critiques say and go try the restaurant myself. I would be more careful when ordering the food but still go with my preference and what others wanted too. I would rather confirm twice with Friend B because it was their birthday after all, and not me and Friend A. If Friend B was okay with the booking, then I see no issue to cancel the plan out, whatever. I would probably not going to talk with Friend A that night until later day. If Friend A recognise their fault, they should apologise and explain in detail what was going on with them.
