I would feel confused and worried about what to do next. However I would probably tell them that we should still go anyway as there isn't much we can do 3 hours before. I would trust reviews from food critics as they would have more experience and could provide trustworthy detail. I would probably call Friend B and ask her for her opinions. I would finally chose to keep the booking because I have already paid for it and I wouldn't want it to go to waste.
