A. My immediate reaction is annoyance. Friend A should have either 1. read some reviews earlier or 2. responded to my messages and helped me decide on a restaurant to go to. 

B. I would (as nicely as I could) tell Friend A that they should have read some reviews earlier and actually helped me when deciding on a restaurant. 

C. It's hard to tell which information is more trustworthy, because on the one hand I don't want to get food poisoning (and the customers may have just been angry and lied in their review), but also food critics critique food as their job, so I would hope that they know what they're talking about. 

D. I would consult more reviews from other sources (not just Google Reviews) to gain a better understanding of the bigger picture and to see what others are saying. 

My final choice would be to keep the booking, due to the fact that it would be difficult to find another restaurant at such short notice and it's for a friend's birthday so I wouldn't want to change plans at the last minute and stress them out on their birthday.
