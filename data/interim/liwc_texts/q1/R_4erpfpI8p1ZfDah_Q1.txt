id be annoyed at first and my first reaction would be disappointment and frustration. id remind friend A that they left me to book the dinner alone so its not really fair for them to have an opinion only three hours before the dinner. id tell them if they can find another restaurant and send me half the deposit i already paid then we can go elsewhere if they really want to. but id show them the great reviews from the food critics and stay confident with my choice of restaurant. ultimately i dont think there will be any other availability's in nearby restaurants so we will end up going to the one i initially chose.
