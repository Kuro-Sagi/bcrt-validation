I would feel annoyed and call my friend an idiot for not saying anything in a month and cancelling 3 hours before. But there is always a solution so I would try to call the restaurant to ask if I could cancel the booking despite it already saying that its non-depositable. 

Restaurant says can cancel: 
i cancel, look for another place and call my mate for approval. 

If the restaurant says no: 
if the booking price was cheap like $50 or under, i would just book another restaurant and lose the money whatever. 

if it wasnt cheap, i would check how long ago this google review was made, whether it looks like someone credible had written it, look at their other google reviews. i would also check what other google reviewers have said about the restaurant. then i would text my mate and say it should be fine because the google reviewer looks stupid and all the other reviews say the restaurant is fine. if the friend still doesnt reply i will give them a call. if they dont pick up and they havent given a solution, then i will go forward with the dinner.

if all of the google reviews say that the restaurant is bad, i will probably just sack the money and book somewhere else and tell my mate that they made a good call and apologise for not double checking the validity of the restaurant. 

theres too many factors to consider when making the final choice so idk
