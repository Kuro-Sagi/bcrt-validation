 Firstly, I would be very annoyed at Friend A for the lack of communication on their end for the entire planning period. I think that we should just stick to the original booking, because its really close to Friend B's birthday and its also non-refundable. I'm assuming that the deposit is pretty pricey too. If Friend A actually responded to our text earlier about restaurant choices prior to putting in the deposit and warned about the food poisoning, then that would've given the opportunity to change restaurants earlier if they were concerned about food poisoning at the chosen restaurant. Also, unless Friend A has reviews or proof about the food poisoning, then I think, again, we should just stick to the original booking. I'm also assuming that we did more than enough research about restaurants in the area, that if there were any food poisoning cases, then it would come up. Thus, we should just keep the original booking.
