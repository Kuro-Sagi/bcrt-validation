My immediate reaction would be irritation and confusion - if Friend A didn't bother to choose the restaurant in the first place, why should they be picky about it now? It feels like they are being insincere too, since the restaurant has great reviews. Perhaps they simply don't like the choice - however, if they didn't, they should've brought it up with me prior. I would ask Friend A why they didn't bring it up with me earlier, as it's too late to cancel (including getting a deposit back). I would also ask if they have heard any negative things firsthand about the place. If not, I would explain my perspective and situation, and how I would want to keep the booking due to the investment of time and money I put in. I would choose in the end to keep the booking, but make it clear to Friend A that my choice is not because I don't trust their judgement, as I dislike hurting others' feelings through confrontation.
