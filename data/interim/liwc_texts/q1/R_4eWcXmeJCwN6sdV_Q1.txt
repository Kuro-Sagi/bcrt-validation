The situation would make me upset and angry with Friend A. I would see the situation as rude and inconsiderate, even if they didn't have that itention. Right away, I would probably send a rash message to Friend A because I would be frustrated and stressed. If i was really upset by the situation I would tell Friend A to sort it out themselves, however I may feel bad and wouldn't want to ruin Friend B's birthday. It would also depend how legit the food posining message was, like if it was from 5 years ago and no other messages that agree or say the same thing. If there were legit food critics that said the place was good, I'd be inclined to discard the bad reviews, also the deposit would make me think the resturant must be pretty nice/ fancy. I would probably ultimately ask Friend A what they would want to do, but if the despoit had to be paid I was ask Friend B to split it.
