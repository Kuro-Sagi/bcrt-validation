You did not decide to initially help when planning for friend B's birthday and instead ghosted my texts. Your input is late and would have been much appreciated when I first asked for your opinions as well as any other thoughts or concerns you had. I have done some research and looked through a couple restaurants, according to food critics (which in my opinion are more reliable sources than the average customer) the restaurant is rated highly. Despite this, if we still wanted to book another restaurant, it would be too last minute as other nearby venues are full so we are much better off sticking with the restaurant that was originally agreed on. I can try to find other restaurants however I don't think we will find one to accommodate our party so last minute, this is exactly why planning prior is important. I will be keeping the booking due to these reasons.
