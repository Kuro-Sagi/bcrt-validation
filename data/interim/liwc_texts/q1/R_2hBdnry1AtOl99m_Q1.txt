Oh no — my heart just dropped when I saw Friend A’s message. We’re only three hours away from dinner, and now I’m being told that the restaurant might have caused food poisoning? Seriously? After all this planning and stress — and especially after A completely ghosted me when I asked for help — this feels like a slap in the face.

My first reaction is frustration. I want to text A something like: “You ignored me for weeks and now suddenly you’re worried?” But I need to stay calm and think this through. I know I can’t just cancel last minute without checking the facts, especially since we’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit.

I’ll start by looking at the Google reviews myself. Are there multiple recent reports of food poisoning or just one or two random comments? I’ll also check the dates — maybe the issue was months ago and already resolved. Then I’ll search the restaurant’s name in local news or social media to see if anything serious was reported.

Given the restaurant’s strong reputation with food critics and how late it is to find alternatives, I’m leaning toward keeping the booking. But to be safe, I’ll call the restaurant directly and ask if they’re aware of any recent complaints. If they’re transparent and confident, I’ll feel better about sticking to the plan.

Unless I find strong evidence that it’s unsafe, I’ll keep the booking. It’s too late and too risky to change now, and Friend B deserves a well-planned birthday dinner — not chaos because Friend A suddenly panicked.
