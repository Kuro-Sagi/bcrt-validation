A. My initial reaction would me being a bit flustered at the response and feeling a bit mad at the sudden switch up in plans. I would also feel a bit angry as I was the one helping plan the outing a month ago, with friend B being unresponsive then and suddenly very responsive now about their opinions about the restaurant booking.

B, I would text back in a calm but logical manner saying that their opinions are slightly last minute and that I have already paid a deposit for the booking. I would also tell them that the 'food poisoning' incident could have been a one off thing, or some random customers writing false reviews. 

C, I would trust the information of food critics, knowing the fact that they review restaurants as a career, and thus have creditable titles. 

D, Before we make a final decision, I would do a google search myself, about the reviews for the restaurant, and if the most recent reviews are rated on the higher side, I would text the friend and tell them this information. If it turned out that Friend A was right, where a bulk of the recent reviews for the restaurant were about food poisoning, then I would either just tank the deposit, or ask that friend to split the deposit (seeing that they were unresponsive about the celebrations a month ago, and that they still have some responsibility over the planning) - I would also do some quick searches for other restaurants. 

Overall, I would keep the booking, seeing that other nearby venues are full and it would be too last minute to change anything.
