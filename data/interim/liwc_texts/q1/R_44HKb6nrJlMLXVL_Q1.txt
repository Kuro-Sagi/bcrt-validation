A. I would feel quite frustrated considering that I have already done all the work. But overall I dont really care because I've already decided, and paid for it myself so they have no right to object.

B. I'd say that its too late considering I've already decided, and that it shouldn't matter too much considering I have already done my part. What they found was most likely a fluke.

C. I'd rather take information from critics and professionals rather than recent google reviews, or any low-rated google review for that matter, considering all restaurants have them.

D. I would have researched for restaurants, depending on the vibe, look, food, and reviews from actual professionals. I would also check reviews from google, I just wouldn't nitpick on details in low rated reviews

I would keep the booking because I already paid a non-refundable book, my friend responded too late, so I get to pick.
