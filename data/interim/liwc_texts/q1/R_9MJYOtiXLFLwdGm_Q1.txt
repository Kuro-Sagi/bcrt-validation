Immediately I would feel annoyed/irritated by Friend A, I would want to yell at them. I would say that they should have considered this before making me choose, as they clearly did not want to and placed the responsibility on me, I would also accuse them of not wanting to eat there in the first place, and finding an excuse to complain. However I would have to consider that the non-refundable booking and reviews do match, but I would look online at specific meals that people who got food poisoning ordered (meat, fish, eggs) and take that into consideration when ordering. Overall I would keep the booking, as I would like to cement to friend A that dumping shared responsibilities without communicating if there were any other outside issues is not something that I value in a friend, and to have to live with the consequences.
