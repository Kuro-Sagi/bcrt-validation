My initial reaction is a mix of annoyance and frustration towards Friend A for bringing up potential food poisoning at such short notice. I feel like they may be trying to cause unnecessary drama or sabotage the plans.

I would likely reply to Friend A expressing my surprise at their sudden concern and questioning why they didn't mention this earlier during our planning.

When deciding which information to trust, I would weigh the credibility of professional critics' reviews against random Google reviews mentioning food poisoning incidents. I would also consider the overall positive reputation of the restaurant.

Before making a final decision, I would quickly search for more recent reviews or news articles about the restaurant to check if there have been any recent food safety issues.

Ultimately, I would stick with the original booking at the restaurant. The positive professional reviews and my past positive experiences there outweigh the last-minute concerns raised by Friend A. I would also keep an eye on everyone's well-being during and after the dinner.
