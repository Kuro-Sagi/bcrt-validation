my immediate gut or emotional reactionï¼š
Hey, serious? It's only three hours until dinner now, and Friend A just sent a message about the issue of choosing a restaurant? I asked him to book a restaurant together a month ago, but he didn't reply to my messages at all at that time. In the end, I had to handle it all by myself and even paid a non-refundable deposit in advance. Now he just throws over a few screenshots of negative reviews and says, "Maybe we don't need to go?" It's really a big deal.

keep the booking
But if no serious situation is found after checking, I will definitely still follow the original plan. It's too hard to change places at the last minute now. All the other better places must be full, and Friend B will also be very unhappy. The overall reputation of this restaurant is quite good. A few negative reviews are not enough to directly deny it.

** Final decision ** : The original reservation is retained. I don't want everyone's mood to be disrupted, and I still trust this restaurant.
