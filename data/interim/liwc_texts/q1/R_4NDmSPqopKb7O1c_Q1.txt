Ugh… seriously? Three hours before the dinner and now they care? I’m honestly so frustrated. Where was this energy a month ago when I asked for help? I tried to involve them and they ghosted me — I was the one who found the restaurant and paid the deposit. And now they send me a few bad reviews and want to cancel?

Okay, breathe. Let’s not overreact.

First of all, I know this place has amazing reviews from actual food critics — like in magazines and blogs. It’s popular for a reason. Sure, someone on Google said they got food poisoning, but those reviews can be unreliable. People exaggerate all the time online. One or two bad reviews among hundreds of positives? Not enough to panic.

I’d text Friend A back and say, “Thanks for the heads-up, but I’ve already paid a non-refundable deposit and the place has great critic reviews. I think we’re good to go.”

Just to be safe, I’d check the restaurant’s Instagram or any recent posts to see if they’ve said anything about health concerns — maybe even call them quickly to confirm everything’s running smoothly.

Final decision? Keep the booking. We’re too close to the event to change now, and there’s no solid reason to believe this place is unsafe. Plus, Friend B deserves a nice dinner, not last-minute chaos.
