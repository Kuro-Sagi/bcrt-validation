friend a needs to fuck off, if they didn't want to go to that fucking restaurant then they should've been involved from the start instead of fucking ghosting me and making me choose the place, not only that but the place is fucking non-refundable, i don't gaf if they don't want to go, imma fucking go regardless. I'd probably text them something semi passive aggressive like: Hey! I didn't realise that you had such a concern from food poisoning, however, it is possible to get food poisoning at any restaurant and we don't know if they got food poisoning from that restaurant or from something else they'd eaten that day. Furthermore, they have amazing reviews from food critics and it's a type of food I believe our friend would like. If you had concerns about this dinner place then you should have shared them when we were meant to be planning where to go. Not three hours before when it would be impossible to get another booking at a place i know our friend would enjoy, and after I've paid a non-refundable booking fee. If it so deeply concerns you then you can reimburse me the booking fee and book another place but I truly don't think its much of a concern.

Keep the booking: disrespectful to change that last minute, non-refundable fee, should've been involved from the beginning, unlikely to get a booking at another place, they should fuck right off.
