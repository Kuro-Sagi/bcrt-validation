A. my immediate emotional reaction to Friend A's late response is frustration. 
B. I would tell Friend A about the non-refundable deposit and food critic reviews and that their response was way too late - shouldve mentioned before i booked
C. While I do trust Friend A's reasoning, I would double check google reviews for the restaurant to gauge how reliable/severe the food poisoning allegations are. 
D. Negotiate with Friend A to stick with the initial restaurant

I would keep the booking due to the lateness of Friend A's response, the non refundable deposit and the counter-argument of great food critic reviews to the food poisoning allegations
