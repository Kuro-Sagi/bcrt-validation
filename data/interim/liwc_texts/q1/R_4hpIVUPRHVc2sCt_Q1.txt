My immediate gut/emotional response would be kinda annoyed - I would have already been a little annoyed because we were both meant to getting this ready for friend B's birthday and they stopped responding, but then to say "hey we shouldn't go" after I chose a place and made a deposit I would be quite annoyed.
I would probably not reply right away, I would look at the reviews and see how long ago they were, and how many of the reviews talk about food poisoning in comparison to total reviews. If the reviews were quite old/if they were only a very few of total reviews, I would reply with these findings, and push that I believe it will be okay.
If these reviews are many and recent, I would reply something like "well what do you think we should do?" and put the burden of working things out on their shoulders.
