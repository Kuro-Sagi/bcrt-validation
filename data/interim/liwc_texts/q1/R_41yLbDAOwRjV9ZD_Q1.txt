My immediate gut reaction would be shock at the news and annoyance/confusion at why the friend responded after so long. I would immediately research to try and see if these reviews are authentic or not and contact the restaurant directly to ask about this. I would also check online on social media. If it's true, I would demand a refund for the booking. What I would mention to the friend is the high rating from food critics and ask why they haven't responded for so long/if everything is alright with them. I would also check in with Friend B first to make sure they can come. My final choice would depend on whether the reviews seem trustworthy and what the restaurant says when I call them. This is because I don't want to have wasted my money as it's not refundable but want to take my friend's text into consideration just in case it is true.
