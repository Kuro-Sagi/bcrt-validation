since i have paid a non-refundable deposit, i may not get my money back cancelling three hours before the reservation. and we might not be able to find anywhere else to eat and this ruins friend B's birthday plans. friend A put no effort or time into choosing the restaurant and now they are going against your choice so close to the time of the reservation and that is annoying and rude and dismissive of your effort, so i think friend A doesn't really deserve a say now, even though they are trying to protect you from food poisoning, but just becasue some people get food poisoning there doesnt mean you will, it is very unlikely. and food critics love to food so it seems to be a good restaurant. therefore, i would keep the booking
