When I received A’s message, my first reaction was frustration. I had asked for help a month ago, and A never responded—now they suddenly question the restaurant hours before the dinner? I felt a mix of anxiety and irritation, especially because I had already paid a non-refundable deposit.

Still, I tried to stay calm. I searched online for the same reviews A mentioned. I found one report of suspected food poisoning, but it wasn’t clear if it was the restaurant’s fault. I also noticed that the restaurant still had many recent positive reviews, especially from food critics. That made me question whether A’s concern was based on solid evidence or just panic.

I texted A and explained that I had already made the booking due to their silence, and changing the plan now would be difficult. I reassured them that I had looked into the reviews again and didn’t find convincing reasons to cancel.

In the end, I decided to stick with the original plan. The restaurant still seemed trustworthy, and it felt unfair to change everything last-minute after all the effort I made.
