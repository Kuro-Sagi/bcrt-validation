Bruh as if you text now what took you so long the restaurant literally have great reviews I don't know what your on about like that is highly infruitating. I say that because most reviews from food critics are positive, we should just go anyways plus all the other restaurants are full now anyways and we need to a place to celebrate. The information should be trustworthy as well as it comes from major food critics so lets just go yeah type.
