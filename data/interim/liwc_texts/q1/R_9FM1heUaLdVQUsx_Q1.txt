My immediate reaction is that friend A shouldnt have an opinion. if I planned it all myself and they dont like the restaurant they shoudlve said something earlier. however, if they hold that opinion strongly id just reply saying i already paid the deposit and if they really want something done then they can pay the deposit and find a new place. i would trust their information if its in a screenshot like theres no reason i shouldnt but then i would go check myself. i would look the restaurant up to see if there are bad reviews and then be like oh i actually found these ones theyre mostly good if they are. i would decide to keep the booking unless the friend wanted to pay the deposit i already paid and wanted to find somewhere else. id probably explain too that most of the review are good and itll be okay anyway.
