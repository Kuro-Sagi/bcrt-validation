I would be annoyed that they ghosted me and felt that they could make judgemental comments about something we were supposed to do together. I would keep these thoughts to myself to try to maintain peace and reply with something along the line of "I have reviewed comments from food critics and the restaurant is held in high regard. Ive already paid a deposit I cannot get back and it is now too late to change to somewhere else." I would be concerned if there were numerous recent reviews talking about food poisoning but if the critic reviews were also recent then I would trust them more. If A was so concerned about it (possibly rightfully so, depends on the date of the reviews) then I would happily switch the restaurant if they organized it and refunded me the deposit. I would lean towards keeping the booking unless I'm refunded, and depending on if A apologized for disappearing I might rethink the friendship.
