A. Why friend A interupt my decision when he did not involve in booking the restaurant. I have already chosen carfully and paid the non-refundable deposit and now you telling me we should not go due to your finding of the bad reviews while i fould their good review. 

B. "Hey, maybe we should find more review on this to discover whether the restaurant is really bad, there is always bad review on google so we should double checked it. Since I have already paid the deposit, if we are not going we need to split this bill. Decide quickly so we have enough time to provide alternative options."

C. I will check multiple websites on the restaurant review or ask friend who have been there or if it is near I will go to the place and check if it is famous and busy. 

D. Check that bad review is recently posted, if not they might have improve on food safety. It can also be purposely misleading review from other restaurant. 
 
I will keep the booking until it is comfirmed that the restaurant is bad or someone give me a better option which i know it is pleasant and split the non-refundable deposit with me.
