Friend A doesn't have the right to suddenly decide that they want to change the resturant when they did not take the responsibility to choose it with me like we had planned. I'd tell Friend A that it is too late to change resturants and they they should of helped me in the beginning if they had a preference. Since the restaurants has had consistently good reviews and the one my friend showed me was a minority I would still consider going and keep the booking. However before that I would check that the food critic reviews are still there.
