In this scenario, I would find Friend A to be quite inconsiderate. My first course of action would be to message them, explaining my perspective of the restaurant having good ratings, as well as a non-refundable deposit. I would also explain that given Friend A's poor response time it was all I could find by myself on short notice. I would then go back over reviews of the place to find evidence supporting my claims around food critic's perspectives and send these to Friend A. I would also then look to see which reviews aligned with their perspective of giving food poisoning and take note of which dishes to potentially avoid to put Friend A's mind at ease. I would choose to keep the booking plans as Friend A should've been more proactive in finding places to book and communicating if they did not want to go to this restaurant.
