Did friend B send a message?
I would feel annoyed right after reading friend A's message. She did not help me find any restaurant, and now she is saying maybe we shouldn't go... without any type of apology and she did not consider that I paid for the deposit. I would make her pay me bakc half of the deposit as it was also her responsibility to find and book a resturaunt for Friend B's birthday. She should also find another restaraunt before saying we shouldn't go. I would not try too hard to decide whether teh information is trustworthy, I would just take her word for it because food poisoning is quite serious and it is not worth the risk. My final choilce would be to change plans but make friend A pay me back half of the deposit.
