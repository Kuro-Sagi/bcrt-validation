I would be annoyed at Friend A for trying to help minute. Afterall, the two of us were supposed to be looking for a restaurant together. If Friend A helped from the beginning, maybe we would have had more information. I would say to Friend A to why he or she was not responding to my messages and all of a sudden you decided to do all this research three hours before the dinner. I would clearly the fault in the lack of effort to try and help yet still have the time to do research and criticize that restaurant I chose. Nevertheless, the dinner is in three hours so I would have to make a decision to either push through with it, reschedule the dinner, or settle for a different restaurant. I would carefully investigate the negative review if it were 'rage bait' or legitimate. I would inspect the review for any exaggerations or extreme biases without any evidence and inspect the person who gave the review. Despite the possibility of food poisoning, I would still push through with the booking since I food critics are more credible sources of information and hope that we won't get food poisoning.
