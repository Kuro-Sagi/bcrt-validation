a) i would feel very upset. If they cared so much about the food we ate why didnt they suggest anything before. 3 hours before is too short notice, as as long as nothing isnt raw it should be fine.
b) i would say; 'hey, i planned this by myself. Its too late to get anything else and i would have appreciated if you communicated this earlier. Next time please help me choose these plans to avoid this again'
c) I just wouldnt care, i would just avoid meaty/ fishy foods
d) I would just go with my restaurant, its too late. I would double check the reviews. Often people leave bad reviews if the service was bad and not if it was good. 

I would keep the booking. It is far too late to change any plans and Friend A was being irresponsible with my planning time. further, i was doing it out of my own free time, it doesn't have to be perfect
