When I read Friend A’s message, I felt very annoyed. Why did they wait so long to say something? They didn’t help before, and now they’re making a problem three hours before the dinner. I also felt worried—what if the food poisoning is real?

I would text Friend A and say, “Thanks for the info. Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” I’d also ask where they found the reviews and when the bad reviews were posted.

To decide if it’s true, I would look at the date of the bad reviews. If they are old, maybe the problem is fixed now. I would also check if many people said the same thing, or just one or two.

I might call the restaurant and ask if they had any food safety problems. If they sound honest and confident, I will feel better.

In the end, I would keep the booking. The deposit is non-refundable, and the critic reviews are still good. I’ll just be extra careful with what I order.
