My immediate reaction is disappointment at the lack of clearance or correspondence regarding their disaffection towards the choice of venue. The first statement I would make is "You haven't given me enough notice, this is non-refundable", as well as "Please consider these reviews and available evidence". To decide trustworthiness, I would consider the merit/rationale of the argument, the source's credibility, as well as the context of the evaluations. An extra check I would make is to run the reviews through an "AI review" detector or check if the business has a coercive review scheme. My final choice is to keep the booking.
