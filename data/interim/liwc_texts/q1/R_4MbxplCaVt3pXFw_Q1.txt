A. I am irritated that Friend A waits until the last minute to have a say regarding the restaurant. If she wanted to do something she should have contributed earlier, but considering she did not do anything prior to 3hrs before the dinner, I would proceed with the plan. 

B. I would tell her that its too late to make changes and there's nothing we can do.

C. I don't really rely on Google Reviews, I would trust food critiques, they are qualified at their job

D. I would check the restaurant's social media pages on any updates regarding food poisoning. 

Ultimately, I would keep the booking.
