A) I will be surprised as the review list I only saw positive comments about the restaurant. Therefore, my gut reaction would be to find the food poisoning comments.

B) I will tell friend A that other restaurants nearby are also already full. And also tell that the restaurant is non-refundable deposit for the booking. However, I will tell friend A that I will check with the comments online to ensure safety when at the restaurant.

C) I will check with other websites that have review about the restaurant in order to ensure the comments are correct and not made up. If there are any comments that talk about food poisoning, I will avoid to order that particular food.

D) Some extra actions I would take is to only eat light food if there is any cases of food poisoning, therefore, would order cheap and safe food to eat to ensure safety.
