The credibility of negative reviews is low: Only one Google review mentioned food poisoning, but the overall rating of the restaurant remained high (such as above 4 stars), and it was recommended by food critics, suggesting that the problem might be an isolated case or an exaggeration. 
Changing the plan is riskier: As dinner time approaches, nearby restaurants are likely to be fully occupied. Making a last-minute change might result in a worse experience (such as long queues, poor service). 
The loss of the deposit is not worthwhile: The non-refundable deposit has already been paid. If there is no conclusive evidence to prove that the restaurant has systematic safety issues, cancelling it is unreasonable. 
Take the initiative to reduce risks: After arriving at the venue, observe the hygiene conditions, avoid consuming raw food or high-risk dishes, and ensure a safe gathering.
