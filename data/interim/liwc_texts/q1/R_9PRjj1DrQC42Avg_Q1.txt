i’d be upset obviously and kinda pissed like they should’ve said something earlier instead of ghosting me for a whole month, and id tell her that maybe but calmly tell them that “hey so the restaurant got rlly good reviews from critics whose opinions are more relevant than some anecdotal experience and i alr paid a deposit and it’s too late now if u had a problem u could’ve said so sooner”. Maybe id read more of the reviews wherever the friend got the reviews from and id trust my own judgement im quite good at finding restaurants and all. And finally id keep the restaurant cuz theres no other ones gonna be open last minute and i don’t wanna lose my deposit, if ppl actually got food poisoning at it repeatedly the place would be shut down
