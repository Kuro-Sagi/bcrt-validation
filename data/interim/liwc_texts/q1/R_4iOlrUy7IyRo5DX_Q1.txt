I would firstly be quite mad, hopefully understandably. The fact he now wants to provide his opinion after Ive paid a deposit has got me angry. I'd want to confront him and say something along the lines of "Oh so now you want to do some research a few hours beforehand when you had a whole month to show me this. Don't start now because you had stopped responding to my texts what else was i supposed to do?" Despite my anger, I'd find him the reviews that I'd read and we'd compare. I'd come up with an ultimatum, because at the end of the day If we end up having a terrible experience it will be on me. I'd propose we don't go, find somewhere else, but he'd have to pay me half the deposit. I would still be angry, but ultimately this event is for Friend B, and tension between Friend A and I would lead to a bad birthday for him.
