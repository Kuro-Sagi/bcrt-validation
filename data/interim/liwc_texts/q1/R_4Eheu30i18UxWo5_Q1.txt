I've made a mistake about choosing the restaurant but it is solvable - maybe - we can always pick another restaurant. Yes there was a non refundable deposit but as long as thee is no cancelation/late fee then we can just go somewhere else. If there is a cancelation/late fee then may be we can just go there for a couple of drinks.
To Friend A, you should've communicated to me straight away if you wanted to be apart of the planning. You can't just ghost someone as you start planning for someone's BIRTHDAY, like you need to communicate if you want a say. 
I would check the google reviews and see how current the negative ones are/check the most current reviews. Just because a place is 4-5 star doesn't mean that currently they deserve that rating, and the most current reviews will explain the current conditions. 
Final choice would be research, and then if the reviews are correct; take it as a fail and just pick another place because at the end of the day you don't want anyone sick on their birthday.
