I would feel annoyed as my plans are being disrupted in this way, especially after friend A stopped responding. I would encourage them to still go through with the booking despite the reviews. Although I would trust the food poisoning information more, as both are online reviews but one is negative meaning there is a higher change of negative impact, I have already made a non-refundable deposit. I would be careful of any food I order and avoid risky food. I would encourage everyone to go still.
