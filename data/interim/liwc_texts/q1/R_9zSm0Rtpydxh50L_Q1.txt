I would feel annoyed as I was ghosted until last minute, where Friend A didn't even contribute to picking and now he is complaining about the place I picked. I would tell Friend A, maybe if he / she helped me earlier, we would have found a better restaurant. I would also call up the restaurant and ensure they have certificates that show how safe their food is, and ask nearby friends if they have had the restaurant and get opinion. I would also if I really cannot find any alternatives, ask Friend B if that restaurant would be suitable for his birthday. I believe if most my friends say it's a good restaurant and they have certificates that ensure they are up to high quality, I would keep the booking.
