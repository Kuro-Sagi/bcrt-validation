When I saw Friend A’s message, honestly, I just felt a bit annoyed. We were supposed to plan this together one month ago, but he didn’t even reply to my texts. Now, only three hours before dinner, suddenly he sends me some screenshots about food poisoning at the place I booked. First thing I think is, “Why bring this up so late? I already paid the deposit and most places are probably booked out now.”
I text Friend A back, “Why are you only saying this now? This place has a lot of good reviews, even food critics recommend it.”I don’t really trust random bad reviews online, because anybody can post them, maybe not even real customers. Most of the feedback for this restaurant is pretty good.But I still double-check. I search the restaurant’s name on Google again and look for any news about serious problems or health issues. If it’s just a few bad reviews and the experts say it’s good, I think it’s fine.So finally, I decide to keep the booking. Too late to change plans, and I don’t see real proof that it’s dangerous. It just feels more practical to stick with the original plan.
