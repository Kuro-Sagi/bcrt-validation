that is so annoying if they had helped me plan and find a restaurant in the first place we wouldnt have to second guess the place. its gonna be impossible to find a restaurant in 3 hours and the google reviews only had CLAIMS regarding food poisoning, no one could have confirmed that they got it from there so we can risk it. im the one who paid the deposit so to her it doesnt matter because she didnt even help plan it whatever. id tell her that its too late now and we dont have any other options, lets just go and order things that would be lessl ikely to give us food poisoning. i do a final search on google, yelp, critics, and tiktok about the restaurant before confirming. but ultimately i think we will settle for this restaurant as we are 3 hours out and have no other possible options.
