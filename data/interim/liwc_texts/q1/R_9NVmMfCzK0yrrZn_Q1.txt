If the prerequisite is that he is my good friend, because my friends will directly tell me if they have any problems, so the reason why he no longer replies to my text messages is not just that. And I will believe his reminder about the restaurant issue, then I will immediately call the restaurant to confront and inquire about the specific situation and ask other friends who like to dine in various restaurants for their opinions about this restaurant, and then make a choice based on the situation. If I judge that it's okay, then I will continue to eat there and explain the restaurant's explanation to friend A. Or if the restaurant fails to convince me, I will choose to cook at home to celebrate my friend's birthday and either threaten to report them or ask for a refund of the deposit.
If he is not the "friend" I consider him to be, then I will stop replying and not invite him to participate. The other procedures will remain the same as before.
