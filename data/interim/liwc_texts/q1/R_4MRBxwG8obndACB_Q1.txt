a. i would feel frustrated and a little annoyed. 
b. i would say something like 'i already booked this place and its too late to book another place. you should have showed me that before. '
c. i would cross-reference with other sources of information, such as reviews, blogs, social media posts etc. i would also discredit the friend because of what they did .
d. i would check the posts about the restaurant and especially if they have food health and safety awards or the general cleanliness of the restaurant would suffice. 

i would be confident in my choice by choosing the initial restaurant because its too late for another and the deposit was non-refundable.
