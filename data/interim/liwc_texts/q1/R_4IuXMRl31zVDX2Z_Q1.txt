Three hours before the dinner, and now Friend A wants to raise concerns? Where was this energy when I asked them for help a month ago? I can’t believe they ghosted me back then, and now they’re suddenly worried because of a few Google reviews. This feels so unfair I put in the effort, paid the deposit, and now they want to derail the whole plan.

Okay, breathe. Let me look at the screenshots they sent. Yeah, a couple of people are complaining about food poisoning, but I also remember reading reviews from actual food critics who raved about this place. It’s not like every restaurant has perfect reviews even good places can have the occasional bad night. Still, I should double-check. I’ll quickly look up more recent reviews, maybe on a few different platforms like TripAdvisor or even Instagram to see if anyone’s posting about it tonight.

Also, I’ll call the restaurant not to cancel, just to ask a few questions casually. Like what their food safety rating is or if they’ve had any recent complaints. If anything seemed sketchy, I’d feel it.

As for Friend A, I’m tempted to just ignore the message, but I’ll keep it civil. Something like: “I’ve seen some great critic reviews and checked the food safety rating everything looks good. Given the short notice and non-refundable deposit, we’re still going. I hope you’ll come!”

Bottom line: we’re going. Friend B deserves a proper celebration, and this was the best option we had. I’ve done my homework.
