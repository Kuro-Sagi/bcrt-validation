When I first saw A’s message with the screenshot, my immediate reaction was: “Seriously? You tell me this now?”
I felt really annoyed because I had asked for their help a month ago and they ignored me. Now, just three hours before dinner, they suddenly bring this up.
Even though I was upset, I’d probably hold back and reply with something like, “Really? I remember seeing a lot of good reviews before,” just to stay calm on the surface.

Next, I would immediately check Google and other review platforms myself to see if there were more recent reports about food poisoning or if it was just one or two random bad reviews.
I’d also go back to see what the professional food critics said, since I remember this restaurant being highly rated.
If possible, I would message a friend who has been there recently and ask about their experience.
At the same time, I’d look to see if there’s any chance of finding another restaurant at short notice, though three hours before dinner is really tight.
If we really have to change, I would ask A and B to share the cost of the non-refundable deposit.

After thinking about it, I would keep the original booking.
The main reasons are that the majority of reviews are still positive, a single screenshot isn’t reliable, it’s too late to find another place, and I don’t want to waste the deposit I already paid.
