I think I'd tell them that if it has great review from critics then it'd probably be fine and people with bad experiences rant online more than people who have good experiences and i'd also say that there aren't any other places we could go to and we also already had a booking, and i'd think i take the information from the critics more so i would keep the booking because it's a confirmed booking rather then looking around and potentially not being able to get a booking
