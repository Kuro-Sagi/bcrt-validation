My immediate reaction is that Friend A doesn't care enough about Friend B to put any effort into celebrating their birthday and wishes to take credit for planning their birthday celebration without putting any work in. I would tell Friend A that it would be too late to switch what restaurant we go to now and tell them that the reviews I saw online were really positive. Given that Friend A has shown some history in being unreliable and disorganised, I would choose to believe my own research that I've done on the restaurant to eat at since it seems that Friend A is wanting to potentially sabotage the birthday dinner or take credit for organising the celebration at the expense of me and my planning. I would double check that the reviews I saw were positive and send some screenshots of them to Friend A to further prove that we should go to the restaurant I chose. My final choice is that I would keep the booking since it's a nice restaurant with good reviews, and I'm skeptical that Friend A is trying to do something shady on Friend B's birthday.
