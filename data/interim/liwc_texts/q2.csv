R_4jkWGYT7ECy8kAR,"I will be concerned at first, and then question the reliability of the social media GP, because I personally don't trust medical practitioners who are extremely active on social media. I will go search for the journal articles myself, and judge whether the data presented is as he says, or overtly distorted by Dr Miles' personal opinions on the drug. I would also see if the article is reliable and peer-reviewed. I might also look at similar articles, and if it is as detrimental as he says, I'll send the articles to my own doctor, and ask for explanations. I'll switch doctors if I believe my own doctor isn't valid after his explanations. If it isn't the case, and it doesn't pose a serious long-term risk, I'll still probably find another doctor and ask them if they also believe that I can use the drug. If this doctor also approves, I will use it."
R_4VJzj3BEMoQSS75,"Oh. I should go back to the doctor and show them the video and studies just to confirm whether Medex works well with minimal side effects. I would also do a bit of my own research online maybe on reddit to see what others who have used the medication are saying and if they felt anything different or bad when using it. I'll also research Dr Miles' credentials to see if he's legit because I can't trust GP's online because they're kind of content creators, and they're not always honest. I'll also check out those studies myself to see if he's omitting any information that might be cruical, for example, those people who suffered serious long-term risk to their liver health could have previously had liver troubles or drank too much or things like that. I would ultimately base my decision off several factors, for now, I'd probably avoid taking it until I can talk to the clinician about it."
R_4EpdmEXYNxaBzKp,I would be shocked and tell my family immediately for advise. I would check with the doctor that gave me the medication and see what he says and research about it online before taking it.
R_4RTXhjjlqGwpjco,"A) My immediate reaction would be surprised as the packaging of the product says it has minimal side effects that are mild. However, my gut reaction would tell me to check other sources other than Dr Herbert Miles to ensure other practising GP are on the same page as him. B) I would warn any friends and family about the information after I check with my clinician and any other clinician to ensure all of them agree with Dr Miles or not. This can help find if Dr Miles is trustworthy or not to ensure safety of consuming Medex. C) To decide if the information is trustworthy or not, I will check with other clinicians about Dr Miles claims about Medex and to check online if any sources agree with his claims. Furthermore, I will check online comments to see what they think about his claims. D) I will see how the situation will go after 2 weeks after Dr Miles claims."
R_9nP1v1oCAVi3ZEY,"My immediate reaction is to want more information. I would try and find the journal articles to read myself, and start doing some further research into Medex and see if there are many competing opinions. I'd also watch a few other videos from Dr Miles, and see if his other videos seem reasonable and balanced, or if they seem 'click-baity' and share views that frequently oppose the general opinion from medical journals and other clinicians. Once I read through the articles he quoted, if I felt the journal was clearly aligned with Dr Miles' interpretation, I would book another appointment with my doctor to discuss. However, it would depend on the Dr that originally prescribed me the drug. For example, I've been seeing my current GP for 10 years and I really trust her as a doctor, and I think her knowledge of me and my health history would mean I easily trust her over another Dr I've never met. But if for some reason I had to see another GP or specialist I didn't know very well, I would be way more likely to take the video from Dr Miles seriously. I would also try and verify his qualifications, and try to get an idea of his reputation in the medical field. In this situation, I would do my own research, but only if there was heaps of well documented research that supported Dr Miles, I would trust my own doctor oveer him."
R_4qluSYSvHUIOf2k,A. I would be confused as to whether or not the drug is actually safe for me to do and slightly concerned. B. I would show my clinician the video and question them on whether or not this was true or not. I would do further research myself to determine whether I should take the drug or avoid it. C. By showing the clinician the video and questioning him as well as doing further research of my own. D. I would do further research of my own to determine if it was safe for me to take and beneficial.
R_9onXY2s2JyVJbhv,i would trust my actual doctor although id be aware
R_4HeSPUC68yjFO8N,"When I watched Dr. Herbert Miles' video, I felt a rush of anxiety. I was relying on Medex to relieve my recurrent headaches based on my doctor's recommendation, but now I'm confronted with this serious long - term risk claim. I'd like to message my doctor, asking for clarification. I'd say, ""Doctor, I just saw a video from Dr. Herbert Miles warning about the severe long - term liver risks of Medex. Is this true? You told me the side effects were mild."" To determine which information is trustworthy, I'd look into the medical journal articles that Dr. Miles showed. I'd check if they are from reputable journals and if the research methodology is sound. I'd also consider the doctor's professional standing and the credibility of his sources. Before making a choice, I'd contact my doctor's office to schedule a follow - up appointment. I'd ask for their opinion on these new concerns and if there are alternative medications. After careful consideration, I'd decide not to start taking Medex for now. The potential liver risk is too concerning, and until I can get a more comprehensive and reassuring explanation from my doctor, it's not worth the risk."
R_4od1XXDsfRPjEXm,"I would subconsciously believe that Dr Herbert Miles' remarks saved my life. I would first ask the clinical doctor about the content of this video and whether the pictures of the medical journal articles shown in it are genuine. If it were me, I would share this video with my friends and family to alert them to the harm this drug causes to the liver. I initially assumed that Dr Herbert Miles was a practicing general practitioner, and because he had scientific evidence to support it, and I was indeed unaware of the harmful effects of this drug on the liver, I would be more likely to believe him. But eventually, I went back to ask several different clinical professionals, including the doctor who prescribed the medication, about the authenticity of this video. If this drug does cause significant harm to my liver, I would choose not to take it. If not, I would follow the doctor's advice and take it."
R_46sDFz0luDI3hex,"A. My immediate reaction would be one of dread, but it would quickly turn into suspicion. B. I would show my clinician the video and ask them about it. If my friends or family were also on the medication I would send the video and the mentioned studies to them just to let them know, probably by saying ""Hey, I'm not sure if you're aware, but this might be something you need to talk to your doctor about."" I'd try to word it in a way that wouldn't scare them, but would gently suggest that maybe there's a conversation that needs to be had with their doctor. If none of my family or friends were also on the medication, I probably wouldn't mention it to them. C. I would conduct my own research and consult additional sources (especially peer-reviewed articles) to gain a better understanding of the bigger picture and to better educate myself. I would probably choose to trust my doctor, but again, more information is required and I would need an explanation from them before making a decision."
R_4s649qip03SoHtv,"When I first watched Dr. Herbert Miles’ video about Medex, I felt confused and a bit worried. I had just seen my doctor earlier that day, and she told me Medex was safe and effective, with only mild side effects. Now this popular doctor online was warning about serious long-term liver damage? It felt like a contradiction, and I didn’t know who to believe at first. I wanted to message my doctor right away and ask, “Have you seen this video? Is it true what he says about liver damage?” I also thought about sending the video to a couple of friends or family members to hear their opinions. I trust my doctor, but seeing someone with a big following speak so confidently made me question things. Before making any decision, I would do a few things: 1. Look up the journal articles Dr. Miles showed in his video and see if his interpretation matches the actual research. 2. Check whether those studies were recent, peer-reviewed, and supported by other research. 3. Look for other expert opinions from reliable medical websites or healthcare professionals—not just social media. After reviewing everything, if there’s no strong scientific evidence to support his claims, and if my own doctor assures me again that Medex is safe for my condition, I would decide to **go ahead and take Medex**. I trust the medical advice from a trained professional who knows my health history more than a social media post, even if it’s from a licensed doctor. But I’ll also ask to monitor my liver just in case, and stay alert to any new research."
R_4n9nWCM2ZXttznb,"If I saw that post my initial gut reaction would be some sort of anxiety or terror. And then I think I would read through the comments, but try to stop myself because that would just send me into a whole spiral of anxiety and worry. I would immediately search up articles online, also I would definitely look at where Dr Miles got this information and data from, (ie any sort of research, articles and also maybe some other information from further medical clinicians). Then I would message my friends or acquaintances, maybe people who have used this medicine before and ask them. But most importantly I would ask my doctor, and also maybe go to several other GPs and ask for their opinions. After collecting sufficient information I would decide whether to continue to use this medicine or not."
R_9PBO2RW2Uhn7yYb,"I think I’ll message my doctor first: “Hi, I came across a video from Dr Herbert Miles saying Medex could harm liver health in the long run. Just wanted to check — is this a known risk? Should I be concerned?” At the same time, I’ll search PubMed or look up official drug safety information from health authorities like the FDA or the Australian TGA. I’ll check for systematic reviews, not just cherry-picked articles. Also, I’d see if Dr Miles has a history of sensational claims or if he’s respected in the medical community. Final decision: I’ll wait before taking Medex."
R_41NjFgMFB7MhGSU,"When I first watch the video, I feel mix of doubt and fear. The claim that Medex could harm my liver is unsettling, especially since my doctor assured me it was safe and minimal side effects. The images of medical journals make the warning feel urgent but I also think about why my physician wouldn't have mentioned such a serious risk. The conflicting comments under the post add up my confusion. Some people seem grateful for the warning while others say Dr.Miles misrepresent data. I would contact my doctor for clarification and send message ""I saw video about Medex has long-term liver risks that wasn't discussed during my appointment. Can you help me understand if this is a credible concern?"" I'll also research more and check for reliable resources such as Medex's official leaflet for listed side effects. After gathering more information, I would continue taking Medex ad prescribed but stay cautious. But, I'll follow up with my doctor if new concerns rise up."
R_4rCqFmyvttIJsWm,"A. My immediate thoughts would be doubt and likely anxiety, even if it was untrue just because its uncommon for someone to directly have an interest in denying a treatment works. I might also just be incredibly skeptical of Dr. Miles to the point of derision and eyerolling. B. I would do further research before going to my clinician for anything, maybe go to a 2nd one for a 2nd opinion. I'd probably vent to friends and family, or just poke fun at it. C. I'd take it from a variety of sources, but likely not in the form of short videos. I'd see if there's a literature basis, and if some bloggers have spoken about it, or I'd just measure my body itself and see how my liver is doing. D. I would have utmost faith in my own bodily systems for my wellbeing, but for online sources I'd simply see if their opinions line up with my existing solid ones first."
R_4Ovi2m6ohfWjyD3,"Hmmmmmm... On one side my doctor has said that Medex it a safe drug which works well to combat recurring headaches. On the other hand, Dr Miles has provided clear evidence of serious risk to my liver health. I really should give those medical articles a read right away. I should ask my parents what they think about the whole situation and ask for their input. First I would gather information about the pros and cons surrounding the use of the drug by reading the articles and consulting other people before I choose to take the drug."
R_9rvi3VigpT7nmet,"Watching Dr. Herbert Miles' video gives me an immediate sense of uncertainty and anxiety. The idea that Medex, which I’ve just been prescribed for headaches, could harm my liver is alarming, especially since the doctor mentioned minimal side effects. The images of medical journals he shows look convincing, but I don’t know if the data is being presented in the right context. My gut reaction is to feel a bit scared, but also skeptical because it feels like a lot of health claims on social media are often exaggerated or misleading. I’d message my doctor right away to ask if they’re aware of any potential liver risks with Medex. I’d also talk to friends or family who are more knowledgeable about medications to get their perspective. I’d want to make sure the information I’m getting is well-rounded, so I’d also do some research myself, looking at reputable medical sources and possibly asking for a second opinion from another healthcare professional. To decide which information is trustworthy, I’d prioritise sources like peer-reviewed journal articles, government health websites, and medical professionals over social media posts. I’d also cross-check Dr. Miles' claims with the package insert or official details on the medication. In the end, my final decision would depend on the answers I get from my doctor and my own research. If the liver risk claims are confirmed, I might reconsider taking Medex or explore alternative treatments. However, if my doctor reassures me with scientific evidence, I’d likely proceed with the medication."
R_4pDzw3tv0JSJIeL,"My first reaction is worry — liver damage sounds serious, and I feel uneasy about taking Medex now. But at the same time, I remind myself that my doctor, who knows my medical history, recommended it and said the side effects are mild. Social media posts can be sensationalised to get attention, even if they show “evidence.” I’d probably message my doctor or call the clinic tomorrow, saying something like, “I saw a video by Dr Herbert Miles warning about liver damage from Medex — is this a real concern?” I might also ask friends or family if they’ve heard anything similar, just to see if this is widely discussed. To judge the trustworthiness, I’d look at whether Dr Miles cited recent peer-reviewed research or if the articles are old or taken out of context. I’d also check reputable health websites or government advisories. Final decision: I’ll start Medex as prescribed for now because my headaches are recurring and my doctor assessed it as safe for me. But I’ll follow up with my doctor soon to clarify the liver risk and possibly explore alternatives if there’s solid evidence."
R_9qVrcNn6GPJONYR,"My immediate reaction would be full of fear and concern regarding my health, but I would not accuse the doctor who prescribed me Medex right there and then I would first make sure that the information I came across online is true if it is correct and the doctor kept me in the dark about the serious long term risks, I would confront him and askfor the correct alternative"
R_4nCAtz7tZUEK7HU,"My immediate reaction would be one of caution, as if this online doctor is as reputable as he claims to be then this warning should hold some merit and be taken into account. If anyone I knew was also taking the medication, I would ask them if they knew anything about the warnings the online doctor provided, and if i thought the warning was severe enough I would also ask my clinician about it. However, taking into account that several comments on the video said the data was being misinterpreted, I would try to do my own research to ascertain what the actual medical studies said about Medex."
R_9rqxaybI5jjJniN,"Firstly, my first reaction was that more detailed research is needed on the specific effects and side effects of this medication, and I cannot just follow the advice of one doctor. Secondly, I would like to communicate with clinical doctors that when prescribing over-the-counter drugs, detailed descriptions of the drug's effects and side effects should be provided, along with professional medical advice for patients to refer to, rather than simply stating mild side effects. Furthermore, regarding Dr. Miles' warning, a detailed understanding should be conducted on whether the long-term risk of this drug to the liver is within a controllable range. I will ultimately choose to continue taking this medication because Dr. Myers only introduced the side effects of this medication, but he did not provide a targeted medical assessment for my recurrent headache symptoms. Therefore, I chose to consult with my doctor for more information."
R_9dEoPRV5JbfOXpD,"A. Immediate Emotional Reaction** My first reaction is a mix of confusion and anxiety. The doctor who prescribed Medex presented it as safe and effective, but now a seemingly credible source—Dr. Miles—is warning about serious liver risks. The conflicting information makes me uneasy, especially since headaches already impact my quality of life. I question why my doctor didn’t mention these risks and whether I’m missing critical information. **B. Communication with Others** I’d message my prescribing doctor: *""I saw Dr. Miles’ warning about Medex’s potential liver risks. Could you clarify if this applies to my case or if there are safer alternatives?""* To friends/family, I might ask: *""Have you heard about Medex’s side effects? A viral video is claiming it’s riskier than advertised.""* Their experiences could provide perspective. **C. Assessing Information Credibility** To evaluate the claims: 1. **Verify Dr. Miles’ credentials**: Is he a reputable specialist, or does he have a history of controversy? 2. **Examine the journal articles he cited**: Are they from peer-reviewed sources? Do the studies involve long-term human trials? 3. **Check official health advisories**: Do FDA or other medical bodies mention these risks? 4. **Review Medex’s official leaflet**: Does it disclose liver-related warnings? **D. Additional Actions** - Schedule a follow-up with my doctor to discuss concerns. - Research patient forums for firsthand experiences with Medex. - Consider starting with a half-dose while monitoring for side effects, if I proceed. **Final Decision** Unless Dr. Miles’ claims are backed by robust evidence, I’d likely take Medex as prescribed—but only after my doctor addresses the concerns. The clinical trial data and my doctor’s expertise outweigh a single viral video, but I’d stay alert for symptoms like fatigue or jaundice. If alternatives exist with similar efficacy but fewer risks, I’d request a switch. **Reasoning**: Medical decisions should prioritize trusted, verified sources over sensationalized claims, but patient advocacy matters too. I’d balance both by seeking clarification while proceeding cautiously."
R_48H5gk6KZzuoe1V,"Oh no, this is confusing. My immediate gut reaction is anxiety and doubt — I trusted my doctor but now this video makes me worry about liver damage. I feel a bit overwhelmed because both seem credible: my doctor is a professional and so is Dr Miles. I would probably send a quick message to a friend who knows more about health or medicine, just to see what they think. Then I might message my doctor: “Hi, I just saw a video warning about liver risks from Medex — is this something I should worry about?” To decide what’s trustworthy, I would look at when the research Dr Miles shows was published — is it recent? Does it match what my doctor said about clinical trials? I’d also check official health websites like the Australian TGA or WHO for reliable information. Before deciding, I would wait and maybe schedule a call with my doctor. My final decision: delay starting Medex until I get clarification directly from my doctor, because their advice is personal and they know my medical history."
R_9uW0SHafhi4vixt,"When I saw the video, I felt confused and a little scared. My doctor said Medex is safe and helps with headaches, but now a popular doctor online says it could hurt my liver in the long run. Who should I believe? I would send the video to my doctor and ask, “What do you think about this?” I trust my doctor because they know my health history. I would also ask if they have seen those studies before. To decide what is true, I would look at the sources. Dr Miles shows journal articles, but I don’t know if he is showing all the facts or just the scary parts. Maybe he is trying to get more views online. Before I take the medicine, I would look up the studies myself and check if real health websites like the government or Mayo Clinic say anything about liver problems. In the end, I would not take Medex yet. I want to wait until my doctor replies and I know more. It’s better to be careful than take a risk."
R_9ncGoQdVn4dUlmm,"Well that is pretty unsettling, I'm not sure who to trust. This doctor online is making a pretty good case with those articles he found and what if it messes up my liver long-term. I need to be cautious. Social media however tends to exaggerate things and strive on fear and drama. I'd probably contact my GP to see whether he has seen this video and if I should be concerned. I trust my doctor but I also want to show that I'm taking initiative. To figure out what's trustworthy, its best to check the image articles in the video and see if they are true and said what they said. Again social media users use dramatic headlines without proper context. If Dr Miles is right, there should be more widespread concern, not just a viral video. I might also talk to a pharmacist. They're often super knowledgeable about drug effects and might offer me useful insight. In the end, I'd hold off on taking Medex for a while till a get proper confirmation. I need proper reassurance and if that can't be acquired then I'll find another solution or prescription."
R_9IYxSYxjx5h2jMM,"I would be super confused and immediately start conducting my research into the drug before consuming it. I would share my concerns with my immediate family and friends, and then go back to the doctor to discuss their opinions. This would decide if I should trust taking the drug or not."
R_9jGQkrcYf5X8zyV,"At first, I thought Medex was a good medicine for my headaches. Since i have watched the video by Dr Herbet Miles I am unsure. Both individuals are doctors with adequate education, and Dr Miles has medical journals supporting his claims. I don't know where I should take the medicine or look for alternatives for my headaches."
R_4RTYxFTZ4Y0JCgj,"A= my immediate thought is that Dr Herbert Miles could have his own agenda. He might be bad mouthing a medication in order to promote a different one. Also, some side effects are only applicable to certain patients with pre-existing medical issues, so the majority of people will be fine and your GP knows your history anyway so they wouldn't recommend it to you knowing you are at risk. B= I wouldn't say anything. C= I'd stick with my GP, he knows my medical history and wouldn't purposfully give me something that could do more damage. D= I would check to see how/why it causes liver damage according to the papers. I would take it because I don't know if the tiktoker has an alterior motive."
R_9j0z8JXT8CPjNa9,"At first I would feel disappointed or frustrated that my doctor did not specify what the mild side effects were. I would present my concerns with my doctor, and try to address all my concerns. If my concerns are not addressed in a manner that makes me assured, I would check the medical journal articles that Dr Herbert Miles listed and make a judgement based on the reliability of those articles. If I deem it necessary, I would not take the medication prescribed by my doctor, especially if I have any lingering concerns. I prefer not to entertain any risks, especially when taking any prescribed drugs, as I have had negative experiences with medication in the past."
R_9tx5ryf4EHIGS7l,"A. Immediate Emotional/Gut Reaction: My first reaction is a mix of anxiety and confusion. The doctor prescribed Medex with confidence, but Dr. Miles’ warning about liver risks feels alarming, especially with the images of medical journals. I feel torn—should I trust my doctor or this online GP with a large following? The popularity of the post adds to my unease; if so many people are engaging with it, maybe there’s truth to it? But then again, the mixed comments make me wonder if the data is being exaggerated or taken out of context. B. Communication with Others: I’d probably message my clinician first: “Hi, I saw a video online warning about Medex and liver risks. Can you clarify if this is something I should worry about?” I might also ask friends or family if they’ve heard anything similar. Discussing it with them could help me gauge whether this is a known concern or just sensationalism. C. Deciding Trustworthiness: I’d compare sources: - Is Dr. Miles credible beyond his follower count? Does he cite specific studies or just show snippets? - What do reputable medical websites (e.g., Mayo Clinic, NHS) say about Medex? - Are the journal articles he referenced peer-reviewed, or is he cherry-picking data? The fact that comments are divided suggests the issue isn’t black-and-white, so I’d dig deeper. D. Checks/Actions Before Deciding: 1. Search for Medex + “liver risk” to see if other experts echo the warning. 2. Check the prescribing leaflet for side effects—does it mention liver issues? 3. Look up Dr. Miles’ background. Is he known for alarmist content or balanced takes? 4. Consider my own health: Do I have liver concerns? Is the benefit of headache relief worth potential risks? Final Decision: For now, I’ll hold off on taking Medex until I hear back from my clinician. If they confirm the risks are minimal based on broader evidence, I’ll proceed cautiously. If not, I’ll ask for alternatives. Trusting a single viral video feels risky, but so does ignoring it entirely—so I’ll prioritize expert advice over online buzz."
R_93ghrbs9UkMfX8J,"my emotional reaction would be wow im very confused and then i search it up for other opinions on it like on reddit, then next time i visit i would also ask my docotor if hes up todate with the finformation and yeah. I will type to chatgpt if its true and ask people and personal experience,"
R_4uDGi9a0ycjkTF3,"1. I would be a little concerned, but I personally trust my personal doctor over an online presence. 2. I would definitely contact my clinician first and ask about the veracity of Dr Miles' claims, as well as the clinical trials for Medex mentioned earlier. I would not contact my family or friends unless they were educated in a school of science and graduated recently. If they do, I would forward the articles mentioned in Dr Miles' video and ask them for their interpretation, and take their advice onto board. 3. I would decide which information is trustworthy depending on the number of scientifically educated opinions I receive for each side. Personally I would still have an inclination to trust my own doctor over Dr Miles. 4. If there is a genuine real concern for Medex causing liver damage, I think I would maybe even go to another doctor at another clinic and ask for their opinion, and whether there are any substitutes. Depending on the information I am presented, I would choose to take Medex or ask for a substitute. However, I am more likely to take Medex just because I trust my personal doctor more than an online presence."
R_9ZAOmb32UlCKiNr,"My first reaction would be fear and hesitation.I would probably ask my clinical doctor again and also talk to famliy and friends who have taken this medication before.I would decide to try the medicine myself,but if I experience any discomfort,even if it’s mild,l would stop taking it immediately."
R_4RWEXebBoYvE0NO,"It depends on how well I know my doctor, whether I met them for the first time today or our regular family doctor. If they were a doctor I knew well, I doubt they’d casually prescribe something with serious liver risks without mentioning it. Additionally, many sources online are inaccurate. Still, I don’t want to ignore it completely. I’ll probably just message my doctor tomorrow or call them and say, “Hey, I saw a video claiming Medex could have long-term liver effects"" As for now, I’ll still take the Medex. I trust the doctor who knows my history and gave me advice face-to-face. If anything sounds off after we talk, I can always stop or switch meds later. But if I didn't know my doctor that well, I might refrain from taking it if I know I wouldn't be seeing them soon but if I was then I would still take it."
R_9rpBq7JtZNZ0MRl,I would feel somewhat confused and question if this drug is ok for me to use given this information I have discovered. I would ask my clinician about this video and Dr Miles to see what he thinks of it to see if I can get any clarification on if the long term effects of the medication have been over exaggerated and only apply to people with certain conditions. I would conduct a brief search of these studies Dr Miles has referred to and get an AI summary to see if they are trustworthy or if the findings from the studies are statistically significant. That would inform my decision whether to trust my clinician or Dr Miles.
R_9QdZGbw9eGv7onD,"Don't think I would really care as my doctor would know about the side effects and warn their patients before hand is generally how doctors operate. Also, I try not to believe everything on social media especially when their are a lot of mixed comments. I might send it to my family(parents) as they are older and have more life experience then me and they would just tell me like what they think and guide me to make the right decision. But I truly believe that there is a lot of fake news on social media. I would take the medicine and if I had another check up in the future with the doctor I might just ask if there are any side effect also would ask the pharmacist before buying."
R_9ByyIa2303GfW0A,"At first, I would feel slightly conflicted as both were doctors. I would think that maybe Dr Herbert Miles is just saying these things about Medex for benefits of popularity, but also on the other hand, the Doctor that handed me the drug could have also made a mistake as it is not impossible. I would message the clinician to double check and do some research myself online. I would also ask my family and friends if they have tried the drug and seen any side effects. I would decide if it is trustworthy based on the collective information."
R_90r7lA63og2GuKL,"Whoa… that video has definitely shaken me up a bit. My gut reaction is anxiety — I mean, the doctor seemed confident, but now here’s another qualified doctor saying it could damage my liver long-term? That’s a pretty serious risk to just brush off. The first thing I’d probably do is message my GP and ask if they’ve seen the video or heard of Dr. Miles. I’d want to hear their take directly, especially since they know my medical history. I might even share the video link with them. At the same time, I’d probably send it to a friend who’s into health science — just to get another view. To figure out what’s actually trustworthy, I’d look up the journals Dr. Miles referred to. Are those peer-reviewed? Recent? Are his claims taken out of context? I’d also check other official sources — like the TGA or medical sites — to see if there are any warnings or updates about Medex. Until then, I wouldn’t start the medication. I’d rather deal with headaches for a few more days than risk something irreversible. Once I’ve double-checked with my doctor and read up on the research myself, I’ll decide — but for now, better safe than sorry."
R_9ly8qis9dlrc9ar,"At first my reaction was either dr miles was either doing this for clout, or possibly new research had surfaced, shedding light on the dangers of this drug. In both cases, I’d still seek out a second opinion, and present what I have been told and seen (the video). I would also consider doing some of my own research, notably the documents dr miles cited in his video testing the validity, checking if it was peer reviewed, when the study was published, etc."
R_4bQXQnGPkraYQ3D,"While watching the video, I would feel some tension and anxiety over the reliability of Medex but would keep some skepticism as not everything on the internet is portrayed accurately. The further into the video I get however, the more nervous I would get as he supports his claims by showing images of medical journal articles, suggesting that the information he is presenting is backed up by other professionals and research conducted on the dangers of Medex. I would first message my family and friends telling them about the risks I saw about the drug and see if they had any additional input and I would then message my clinician asking about the risks and if they knew about it before prescribing it to me, and whether they believe Dr Miles is a trustworthy source of information. I would also try and get a second opinion from another GP and see whether they prescribe Medex as well, and if they don't, I would ask them if they knew about the side effects of Medex to be certain if my previous GP was prescribing me with a dangerous drug."
R_41FkWLVk7rYU62L,"lol guess im screwed. too late I already took the meds so OH WELL. I don't fear death. I know that because Jesus died to save me if I put my trust in him I can have eternal life and go to heaven!!! But its still probably good to be safe. Just in case. I mean i'm only 18 I dont need bad liver health thank you very muchy! i'll go to the doctor and ask her what the deal is. i do trust her shes a close friend and shes really looked after me in the past. she'll be right. also you should'nt believe everything you see on the internet, and those comments did say he was dodgy. we'll go and ask what the big deal is, thats the way to go i'm sure."
R_9IOGliiBUtJWMc9,At first I think I would be very anxious deciding whether to take the medicine and I consider I would be much careful that I would immediately surf on the Internet for more information and have a simple judgement. And personally I would trust the doctor more than the media influencer so I think I would probably make a call and ask him for further details about the medicine.If I couldn't figure out which statement is more reliable I would rather not to take it to ensure my body health but to look for other ways to cure headache.
R_9CNkRH6KOycR6TU,"The video from Dr Miles seems credible, but he only discusses the long-term effects of the drug. It would be a good idea to read some of the academic journals to see if they are helpful in understanding the side effects of Medex as well. Also maybe doing some general research about the drug and seeing what other medical doctors say would be good to see if there is a general consensus. I think I would take Medex only if it was for the short-term, in which I assume I am. If I had chronic headaches, then I would probably want to seek other forms of treatment and not just an over the counter drug."
R_9PYWjHPxUOfIAnw,"I would have doubts about the doctor's decision, but I will not believe Dr Herbert Miles completely. I will ask my doctor about this confusion, I want to know what they think about it. I don't think I would believe any of these information, the reaction of drugs on everyone is different, and Dr Herbert Miles or any other doctor have not published any papers for this opinion. I will decide to use Medex, I will drink more water and do sports everyday to reduce liver burden."
R_9qm6ZczrGsxoZf7,"Due to the nature of this scenario I would be conflicted whether to trust the recommendation of my GP while also taking into account the advice of Dr Herbert Miles. However, understanding the nature of social media posting I would imagine that the information that Dr Miles reports on may not be 100% accurate and would thus require me to check his sources for the root of what he is saying. If I were to return to my GP with the concerns that the social media post had raised I would ask if there was an alternative medication that I could take instead."
R_9CxHjiLEAvYA1Z7,"A. Is this doctor saying the truth? Should i listen to him? Maybe I should search online for more information about this drug. On the other hand, i could ask my doctor to double comfirmed the side effect of drug. B. l'll inform my family about this scenario and ask for advise, and their doctor friends. To the clinician, it is important to notice any posible side effects of the drugs and will have to take into consideration. C. By checking multiple resources and information about the drug from professionals and govenment organisation helps to decide which infomation is trustworthy. D. If the drug really could cause serious long-term risk to liver health, i will definitely not take the drug."
R_4NDmSPqopKb7O1c,"Wait… what? Serious liver damage? But my doctor just said it was safe with mild side effects. This video is kind of alarming — and that guy, Dr Miles, is a GP, right? He sounds confident and even pulled up journal articles. Ugh, now I feel really confused and a bit anxious. I don’t want to mess up my health over a headache med. I think I’d message my doctor — maybe something like, “Hey, I saw a video by Dr Miles warning about long-term liver risks with Medex. Just wanted to check if you’ve seen that data?” I’d probably also ask my friend who’s studying medicine what they think. They’re usually good at breaking these things down. To figure out who to trust, I’d look at where the data is coming from. Are those journal articles peer-reviewed and recent? Or cherry-picked old studies? I’d also check if any official health bodies (like the TGA or FDA) have issued warnings or updated advice about Medex. If not, that says something. Final decision? I’d pause taking Medex for now, until I talk to my doctor and check those articles myself. I don’t want to ignore a possible risk — but I also don’t want to overreact to a social media post. Better to ask and be sure."
R_9AN9hSpXOdSyURH,"A. Can i really trust my doctor or should i trust this doctor online B. Nothing, id be doing my own research on the medication C. By doing research D. Just checking symptoms, past stories and ingredients before choosing my decision"
R_4iUoQNwPj2jAKyv,I would be skeptical of the online doctor as a lot of online doctors claim many things for views or click bait. I would do my own research into the drug and come up with my own opinion and decision. Most likely would still use the drug.
R_9MSYEATuG2THmYs,"A. Be a bit suspicious of the information as two conflicting sources between the different data B. I would try to reach out to the clinician immediantly and see if my family has tried it before etc. C. I'd probably trust the online doctor as he has articles backing him up, but I would have to check the data myself before I do anything. D. I would see if anyone I know has tried the medication before and see from them. Not take medication for the time being"
R_4obtThjO6vzifmO,"A. Speculation. I hope this side effect doesn't affect me B. I would text my clinician that i'll test it out for a few weeks and if I experience anything i'm immediately not taking the medication any more. I'll take my chances with panadol. I would also tell my mother, father and sisters. c. Take everything with a grain of salt. Remember both the good reviews and the bad. Hope for a good reaction D. I would do no checks besides opening tiktok and searching results and peoples experiences with the medication. Then i'll take it myself and see how I go."
R_9fwwUsGWe4ahb3J,"Immediately I would feel nervous and distressed about the risk of liver issues. I would immediately contact family and close friends to ask if they know anyone else taking Medex and if they know of the liver side effects. If their response supports the online doctor I would contact my clinician and question them about the liver effects and ask for an alternative. I would be sceptical about the social media doctor, as often they post controversial information in order to boost their views and income. Ultimately I think I would ask my clinician for an alternative as their are often many drugs available for headaches."
R_91xFvPuhzoLYe09,"is the doctor prescribing medex a reliable doctor according to others? if so, or if they've been a family doctor for years, i would take the medex, since the GP's data, according to some people, is being misrepresented. although, is it worth the potential of serious long-term liver issues, which data may be showing. i think i would prefer to find a different drug or deal with headaches than have liver issues in the future"
R_9Y5jqFKG2qMXrMH,"y first gut reaction is confusion and anxiety. The doctor I trust said Medex is safe with minimal side effects, but now here’s this GP online claiming there are serious long-term liver risks? And he’s showing screenshots of journal articles, so it looks legit—but social media can be such a mixed bag. Part of me wonders: is this real science or sensationalism for clicks? Also, why didn’t my own doctor mention this? Before panicking, I think I’d message my clinician—maybe send them the video link and ask, “Hey, I just came across this post about Medex. Is this something I should be worried about? Have you heard of any new research on liver risks?” I trust their medical opinion more than someone online, even if that person is a GP. But I still want to check—sometimes new studies come out that not every doctor sees right away. As for figuring out what’s trustworthy, I’d want to actually look at the articles Dr Miles cited, myself. Are these real peer-reviewed studies from reputable journals? Are they case reports, large-scale trials, or just speculative editorials? And are the risks relevant to someone like me—taking Medex for headaches occasionally—or are they talking about people who take it daily for years? I’d also check official sources: maybe go on the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) website or check other medical guidelines to see if any updated warnings about Medex have been posted. If this was a massive concern, I’d expect to see it reflected in mainstream health advisories, not just one viral video."
R_42DGL2I53q6AtnU,"Firstly, I would feel a little cautious, as I have received largely different endorsements of the drug from two practicing doctors. I would first read the comments saying the data is misrepresented, and gather some general trends amongst the comments. I would then try to skim some of the medical journal articles Dr Miles has referenced and ascertain for myself if the data is misrepresented. Following this, I would message my clinician with the video and what I had read in the journals and ask for their perspective on it. If they provide a convincing argument against Mike, I would feel comfortable taking Medex - if they do not address this long-term risk to liver health, I would probably ask for alternatives, or get the opinion of another doctor. My final choice lies in how my clinician addresses the video."
R_9zAUnGRFYT3T1fY,A
R_448C7cW8wSXpC6o,"First and foremost, I would be worried. I'd message my clinician and ask for some clarification on the topic. I would like to trust my clinician but probably would not land all my faith onto them, so i would take it to reddit to see what other people say to fact check it. I would probably stay on the medication anyway and won't think much of the side effects because I don't want a self fulfilling prophecy."
R_9tnHNQwVXmXn7Vj,"When I hear that Medex may have had a negative effect, I am surprised by that. I feel a struggle about which advice I should listen to. Should I listen to my personal doctor or listen to Dr. Herbert Miles, who is also a professional doctor? However, Dr. Herbert Miles used some medical journal articles supporting his claim. Therefore, I am maybe 50% on believing what he mentioned. I think my final decision may be not to choose to use Medex. I may ask more professional people to find out if Medex had a negative effect."
R_49s5JaRFUTihinG,"I would have thoughts of distrust and confusion around the true safety of the medicine, where I would question whether its truly safe or not. I would further send my doctor the video by Dr Herbet Miles to my local GP and ask him to debunk or disregard the allegations made towards the true safety of the medicine. I think to would still ultimately decide the medicine is trustworthy as it must have needed to go through intense medical trials to be put on prescription. I would ask around still and be extra cautious in taking the medicine"
R_4Etpbd36eElVfi7,"I would immediately feel a sense of fear and uncertainty. Since it was a drug prescribed by my doctor, I would initially have trusted their word and their expertise on it, and seeing another professional argue against the use of Medex would then make me question who to believe. I would probably then ask my friends or family what they think about it, and bring it up to my doctor. I may also visit another doctor to see if they would prescribe the same, or if they also think that Medex isn't reliable. I would also consult the medical journal articles and read about the results and discussions of the articles, to see if the information they present are legit, or if people are misinterpreting the data."
R_9ceigsEeDCxgZmh,"My immediate reaction would be worry and panic, maybe relief that I haven't yet taken the drug. I would consider the perspectives of other who say the data is misrepresented, as this is quite common in social media. I would fact check what they say by looking through the journal articles myself. If in doubt, I would consult my clinician and seek their advice. Given that social media can be unreliable and that even medical professionals can make false claims, I'm inclined to believe my doctor. While considering the severity of my headaches, I would refrain from taking the medication until I am sure of what information is trustworthy. Considering all the above, I'd likely continue taking the medication."
R_4Qrr4Sxrf7MWyC0,"The moment I watch the video, my immediate gut reaction is anxiety and doubt. I feel slightly panicked because I was just prescribed Medex, and now there’s this doctor claiming it could seriously harm my liver. My first instinct is to think, “Wait, why didn’t my doctor mention this? Did they miss something?” but then I remind myself not to jump to conclusions based on a single social media post. If I were to say something to anyone right away, I might message my clinician or pharmacist, asking, “Hey, I just saw a video about Medex causing liver damage long-term — is this something I should be worried about?” I might also talk to a family member, mostly to get some reassurance, but I’d prefer to consult medical professionals first. To decide what’s trustworthy, I’d think about the sources. Dr Miles is a practising GP, but social media can often exaggerate things for views. I’d want to see whether his claims are supported by peer-reviewed studies, whether the journal articles he showed are credible, and whether health authorities like the TGA, FDA, or WHO have issued warnings. Before making a choice, I’d check reliable medical websites, read independent reviews, and maybe book a quick follow-up call with my doctor to directly discuss the risk versus benefit for me personally. My final decision: I’d hold off on taking Medex until I speak with my doctor again. The potential risk might be exaggerated, but I’d rather be sure, especially if there are alternative treatments for headaches with no controversy."
R_4FEe0xLd6itwVFL,"This video is unsettling. My initial reaction was anxiety and confusion. I had just been reassured by my doctor, and now I see a doctor with a large online following saying that Medex could cause long-term damage to my liver? That's terrifying. Part of me wants to throw these medications away immediately. But I'm also a little sceptical—how do I know who's right? I might send the doctor a message or call the clinic and ask directly, ‘I watched a video warning that Medex could cause liver damage. Should I be concerned about this?’"
R_4K2wWM1201O7BbJ,"Here’s my unfiltered thought process after watching the video: ​​A. Immediate Emotional/Gut Reaction:​​ ""Ugh, why now? Just when I felt relieved about finally having a solution for these headaches... This video instantly spikes my anxiety. The images of medical journals look legit, and he’s a real doctor with a big following—but is he exaggerating for clicks? I feel torn: my own doctor seemed so confident, yet this warning about ‘serious long-term liver risks’ is terrifying. Am I choosing between crippling headaches or ruining my liver? Why didn’t my doctor mention this? Now I’m second-guessing everything."" ​​B. What I’d Say to Clinician/Family:​​ ​​To my doctor:​​ ""Hi Dr. [Name], I saw a viral video by a GP claiming Medex has significant liver risks not widely disclosed. Can we discuss this? Are the studies he cites credible?"" ​​To a trusted friend/family:​​ ""Freaking out a bit—just got prescribed Medex, but this popular online doctor says it’s dangerous. What would you do? Feels like medical whiplash..."" ​​C. Deciding What’s Trustworthy:​​ ​​Source Motive & Credibility:​​ Is Dr. Miles genuinely warning people or chasing viral engagement? Check his past content—does he often make alarmist claims? GP ≠ specialist: Is he a hepatologist or just citing studies he might misinterpret? ​​Evidence vs. Emotion:​​ He showed ‘journal images’—but were they screenshots of full studies or cherry-picked excerpts? Did he share journal names/dates so I can verify? Clinical trials backing my doctor involved thousands; his ""evidence"" might be tiny outlier studies. ​​Consensus Check:​​ Do major health bodies (FDA, NHS) flag this risk? If it’s truly widespread, why isn’t it on Medex’s label? ​​Comments Aren’t Data:​​ Mixed comments mean nothing—crowds aren’t peer review. ​​D. Checks/Actions Before Deciding:​​ ​​Cross-Check Official Sources:​​ Pull Medex’s FDA/EMA safety leaflet → scan for liver warnings. Search PubMed for recent meta-analyses on Medex + liver risk (not single studies). ​​Contextualize the Risk:​​ How ""serious"" is serious? 1 in 100,000? Or 1 in 10? Are high doses/long-term use required? Could risks apply to me? (e.g., I don’t drink alcohol, which often compounds liver strain.) ​​Consult My Doctor (Non-Negotiable):​​ Forward the video/link and ask: ""Can you address this specifically?"" ​​Short-Term Safeguard:​​ If headaches are unbearable tonight, take half the dose while I investigate—avoid full commitment. ​​Final Decision & Why:​​ ​​I’LL START TAKING MEDEX—BUT MONITOR CLOSELY & VERIFY WITH MY DOCTOR.​​ ​​Why:​​ ​​Trust Hierarchy:​​ My doctor’s direct clinical judgment + large-scale trial data outweigh a GP’s social media post—unless evidence emerges that contradicts this. ​​Benefit/Risk Calculus:​​ My headaches significantly impact my life; the proven benefit outweighs a theoretical long-term risk. OTC status implies safety for most users. ​​Mitigation Plan:​​ Immediately email my doctor with the video and request follow-up. Start at the lowest effective dose. Get baseline liver blood tests now and repeat in 3 months. Track symptoms: if I notice fatigue/nausea/jaundice, I’ll stop immediately."
R_2hBdnry1AtOl99m,"The moment I saw Dr Miles’s video, my stomach dropped. I felt confused and honestly, a bit scared. My doctor had just told me that Medex was safe and effective, with only mild side effects — now someone online is saying it could damage my liver long-term? That’s a huge claim, and I don’t want to risk my health. I would probably send the video to my doctor with a message like: “Hi, I just saw this — should I be worried?” I might also bring it up in a family group chat to see if anyone else has heard of these risks. But I also know social media can blow things out of proportion, and not everything online is accurate. To decide what’s trustworthy, I’d look up the actual journal articles shown in the video, if possible, and see what the studies really say. I’d also check if any official health organizations like the TGA or FDA have issued warnings about Medex. Dr Miles might be right — but he could also be selectively presenting information for views. Before I make a final decision, I’ll call my GP and ask about the risks and whether anything’s changed since the clinical trials. I’ll also ask if there’s an alternative to Medex that’s just as effective but with less controversy. Final decision: I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now until I speak directly with my doctor. I want to be sure I’m not putting my liver at risk unnecessarily, but I also don’t want to jump to conclusions based on social media panic. My health is too important."
R_9viZJcOtFe2UMZI,"my immediate gut reaction is probably anxiety, because I'm hypochondriac leaning. I'd probably go do some online research from trusted science peer-reviewed articles. if these articles said that medex could, but doesn't necessarily pose serious long term risk, or just anything that isn't 'definitely causes risk', I'd probably feel less anxious. if the science articles said it doesn't, then I wouldn't take any action. if they say could, I'd probably go check back with my doctor. if they say 'will', then I'd freak out, check back with my doctor, and then if they continue to reassure me that it's fine, I'd find another doctor to go to. I'd also probably look into the comments who say that the data is being misrepresented. it's dangerous to fully trust people online- especially this doctor. there's biases in psychology that I learnt about, which makes us trust online actors more than we should, so I definitely wouldn't be quick to fully trust this online doctor."
R_9qCqgxLFaxmotAR,"I would distrust the video as plenty of posts on social media are designed with the algorithm in mind and there is rarely critical analysis of information even if it may appear true on the surface. I wouldn't contact anyone, I would find the journal articles he mentioned and read them myself. If i struggled to understand them then I would reach out to my doctor and bring the articles with me. I would carefully analyse the information as much as I could before making a decision however I absolutely would lean towards trusting my own doctor assuming I've been with them for a long time. Assuming I can't find anything major, I would take the medication."
R_4IuXMRl31zVDX2Z,"Liver damage? That’s not what my doctor said at all. This is kind of scary. I was feeling okay about taking Medex, especially since my doctor seemed confident it was safe and even said side effects were mild. But now I’m seeing this video from Dr Miles and he’s an actual GP with journal articles backing him up? I don’t want to mess around with my liver, especially if there’s a real risk. At the same time, I know social media can blow things out of proportion. Just because someone has a big following doesn't mean everything they say is balanced or up to date. Still, it makes me hesitate. I think I’ll message my doctor and ask directly about what Dr Miles said maybe even include a link to the video. Something like, “Hi, I came across this post saying Medex could have serious long-term effects on the liver. Is this something I should be worried about?” I’ll also check the official health websites like the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) or even look up the medical articles Dr Miles flashed on screen, if I can find them. If the articles are real and recent, that might mean there's more to this than what my doctor first told me. I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now, at least until I’ve cleared this up properly. I’d rather deal with a headache than unknowingly risk something worse."
R_9f8TBp2vAQXd329,"When I come across that video, I will definitely be worried and I will certainly panic. After seeing that video, I would message my doctor and send him the link of the video, and asked if what the video is saying is correct or not to make sure. I would certainly not only ask the doctor, I would go to the nearest pharmacy and ask the pharmacist if whatever the video is saying correct or not. I would also read the articles being shown in the video to see if Dr Herbert Miles is right or wrong. I would also search up about this in the internet. If most of the answer that I got said that Dr Herbert Miles is right then I would not consume the medicine given and I would just go to the nearest pharmacy and ask for another medicine for my illness."
R_9QLchgtc6B8476G,"A. scared as i do not want to have serious liver problems and annoyed as i was not informed about these more serious risks of the medication, even if they have a low chance i would prefer to know B. ask my clinician what he thinks about the video and studies, ask why he did not tell me these potential risks, ask my family for their input on the risks to gather information on family history to find my susceptibility etc C. double check the significance of the results of the studies the dr used to back up the claim in his video, double check if the images the dr showed were factual D. research more into the supposed liver problems and the specific medication, find other research studies, maybe ones that find no risk / mild risks when taking the medication Final choice is to continue to take the drug i was prescribed - i can book another appt with my dr to confirm if it is factual as well as discussing my specific susceptibility"
R_93vFP1P8RlZwhtL,"First of all, I will feel extremely confused. Next, I will discuss this matter with my friends to evaluate the claims of these two doctors, as well as the genuine reactions of the netizens, and explore the potential mechanism of action of this drug. I think I might have been influenced by Dr. Herbert Myers to question my doctor because he is more authoritative. I will carefully read these comments and discuss with my doctor again whether to continue taking this drug or if there are other alternative drugs that can serve as substitutes. I think I will probably replace this drug because I believe more in the opinions of the actual netizens, especially in this situation where the conclusion is unclear, the actual feelings for me are more convincing."
R_41Ba1as7ba32vsJ,"I would not be worried as I have seen multiple examples of people just lying online - I would much rather trust my own doctor than this guy online. I would probably not mention it to my friends or family apart from just in random conversation as some stupid guy online to laugh at, but I probably would bring it up to my clinician. I'd probably get him to take a look at the video and just kind of walk me through each part of the side effects presented by Dr Herbert Miles. The fact that medical journal articles support this claim doesn't really add much weight, as I understand that medicine is a field that is still very much developing and you could just as easily find studies supporting it as against it, something which I might be inclined to check. Thus I would start taking Medex as if nothing happened."
R_9Z7mlqmSLzfiFhf,"Oh no this is so scary. I know online stuff are normally exaggerated and those people online might be taking things out of its context just to scare us and gain their views but I am not going to risk it. Maybe I should see if there are any other remedies for headaches. I am going to search online for those articles and see them for myself and see if anyone else has said anything about this medicine. I might also go back to the doctor to ask about this medicine, but for now I will not be having it until I have more information on it."
R_41yLbDAOwRjV9ZD,My immediate gut reaction would be shock and suspicion. I would immediately do more research on the GP's video and check out all his sources to see if they are reputable. I would also search for customer testimonies to see if anyone is experiencing major symptoms or discomfort after using the medicine. I would ask the clinician about the video I saw to see their opinion on it and also consult with friends and family. I would decide which information is trustworthy based on experience and expertise. My final decision would likely be to not take the medicine as there are surely other ones that would not have these side effects which work just as well and I'd rather not risk it.
R_9AMDoqFupvbMn0u,"At first I will be very concerned for my health and wellbeing. However I'm not bothered to look at journals and articles by myself, so I would stop taking Medex overall and switch to other medicine that have less debate around the side effect of the drug. I will also consult opinions from clinics and pharmacy. But then I know that nearly all medicine affect the liver and the data might not look at users interactions with other drugs which could also affect their liver health. It also depends on the duration that I'm required to take the drug, if it's short-termed, I would take it, if it's to treat chronic headache then I might go in for another consultation. If I have to decide, I will take the drug, because I trust my doctor. But increase the rate of going for health checkups to see if it's really effecting me personally."
R_9FM1heUaLdVQUsx,"my immediate reaction would be like oh no thats not good but also its social media and long term risk like lots of things have long term risks but ill be fine. i would probably bring it up to my friends/ family if i was talking to them but wouldnt go out my way to message them and just be like oh this is kinda funny and hear their opinion. maybe though after talking to my friends/ family i would do my own research to see what is being said about it. i would trust my doctor rather than the one on social media because lots of that information isnt accurate and stretched from the truth. however, i would be slightly concerned and if my own research said it was bad i would stop taking it and ask my doctor. maybe. i dont think i would think about it too much to be honest."
R_9IYl1rZSCRvKRkD,"I would be taken back and curious and confused. I would research the supposed data and evidence that dr miles presented and have a look at it myself, following this I would message the clinician and double check if any of the data was actually accurate. if I was still confused I would seek another opinion from another doctor, and depending on that I would either choose to take the drug or not with more research and information."
R_4jBC0qyqsZWEaQL,"At first, I would be confused and a little scared, because I would need to take this medication. I would probably forward the video to my friend or family member to ask if they have any relevant knowledge or insight. I would then search the internet, and most likely, I would first use the AI to ask for knowledge about the medication. If possible, I would look up the academic journal article mentioned in the video and give the article to the AI for judgment, as I do not have the relevant general medical knowledge. If the AI's response is the same as in the video, then I will contact my doctor to discuss my concerns and distress and stop taking the medication until I can talk to my doctor. If both of the AI's responses can prove that the medication has no or only ignored side effects, then I would continue to take the medication."
R_4fEgJqtJj1UGFQQ,"A. skeptical B. Share the post with my clinician and ask him for his input. C. Read the medical journal articles myself and weigh the arguments provided to me. D. Final decision would be to trust my clinician, as the influencer doctor could be purposefully sharing misleading information to get more engagement from his followers."
R_4hA67MOCRzYcpR4,"Watching Dr Miles' video first made me anxious—my doctor said Medex was safe, but this warning about liver risks felt alarming. I’d message my doctor right away: “I saw Dr Miles’ video on Medex’s liver risks. Should I be worried? What do you think?” To check credibility, I’d look at the studies Dr Miles cited—are they peer-reviewed? I’d also ask my doctor for their source of info. I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now. Until I get clear answers from my doctor or more research, it feels safer to wait."
R_4NwhRxEgkSXBV03,A id definitely be concerned and immediately trust dr herbert miles but then id come to my sense and try to find more research B id tell them about what i found and what i should do C id rather trust dr herbert miles than the doctor prescribing because its better to not take something than to take something - consider different options e.g. ibuprofen or paracetamol D - id definitely research before hand to see how many findings dr miles has gotten from it and if anyone else has similar views but id still not take the drug because its better not to induce more harmful symptoms than have a headache
R_9Brhp62AwtSXskk,"I would be somewhat skeptical. I would be slightly worried about the long-term side effects, but the good thing is that I have not tried it for more than a day. So, if there were any side effects, it probably would not impact me as much. I would probably alert my friends and family members that also use the drug, and I would immediately consult my doctor about it. I wouldn't believe everything on social media, even if it were a doctor with a large following. And I'd also consider that the journals that the Dr. Herbert Miles showed - are only the ones that show negative effects of the drugs. Results can vary from person to person. I would probably rely on credible online sources to check if my medication is safe to consume in the long run. And just to be sure, I would ask for a second opinion from a different doctor."
R_9gSCcbS1E3C8iTw,"I would initially be worried about the medicine I am taking. I would tell family and friends of the video I found online. However, I would consider what my own doctor prescribed to me as what you see online is not necessarily true. I would however express my concerns to my doctor and ask for clarification."
R_9eahWs8Qec76gmd,"When I saw the video by Dr. Herbert Miles, I felt uncertain but not panicked. These days, many people on social media pretend to be doctors or spread false medical advice just to go viral. So I knew I had to stay calm and check the facts before reacting emotionally. I would message my prescribing doctor the next morning and ask clearly: “I saw a video saying Medex could harm the liver long-term. Can you help me understand if this is true?” I would also try to book appointments with one or two other doctors for second and third opinions. To decide who is trustworthy, I’d look for official qualifications, check whether Dr. Miles is a licensed GP, and see if the medical journal articles he shows are from peer-reviewed sources. If the journals are real but misquoted, that would change everything. Before making any decision, I want solid evidence. Only after speaking to professionals and reading real studies would I decide whether to take Medex. For now, I would pause taking the medicine until I feel confident that it is safe."
R_962o5xFSw9PbNFZ,"I'd feel uneasy watching Dr Miles confidently claim Medex could harm my liver long-term.I don’t want to take something that could silently damage my liver, but I also don’t want to overreact to internet fear-mongering. I’d probably text a close friend something like, “Hey, have you ever heard anything bad about Medex? Just saw this video and now I’m paranoid.” Then I’d think about messaging my doctor: “I came across a video warning about Medex and liver damage. Could we talk about this before I start taking it?” I’d want to hear their take especially if they’ve read the studies Dr Miles references. Dr Miles is a GP, so that lends him credibility. But my own doctor knows my medical history — and also said Medex was backed by trials. I’d want to look up the studies mentioned in the video myself, or find summaries from reputable medical websites or journals. I’d also check if any health agencies (like the NHS or FDA) have issued warnings or guidance about Medex I’d not start taking Medex right away. I’d wait until I could speak with my doctor again and review those studies myself. It’s not that I fully believe Dr Miles, but I now feel a reasonable doubt that deserves clarification. Until I get more clarity, I’d rather err on the side of caution."
R_9I5GBWmOLvqXYfX,"I would do my own research into the drug regarding Dr Miles' claims, because the claims are very serious and as a practising GP citing medical journals in his claim, he has credibility. I would look into Dr Miles himself - where he practises, what other content he has posted online and his personal credibility. I would research these medical journals he cites and what they say, but also research other articles that support Medex as a safe drug. It is also prudent to look into what other doctors say and conclude about the drug. If I depend on the information stated without doing further research, I would not take the drug just to be on the safe side and look for alternative, more reliable drugs."
R_9qeyHfp7rwmBIii,"Okay, that video really caught me off guard. I just got prescribed Medex today, and my doctor said it’s safe with only mild side effects. But now Dr. Herbert Miles, who seems credible and has a big following, is warning about serious long-term liver risks? And he even showed medical journal images to back it up. That’s pretty worrying. But then again, the comments are mixed, like some people say the data might be misrepresented, so maybe it’s not as clear-cut as he makes it seem. I don’t want to ignore a potential risk, especially something serious like liver damage. But I also don’t want to panic over social media claims without solid proof. I think I should check with my doctor again and maybe bring up this video and ask for their perspective on these concerns. In the meantime, I’ll probably hold off on taking Medex until I get more clarity. It’s important to be cautious but not jump to conclusions based on one video alone."
R_4OUZZKs5XdB6yKX,"I would be suspicious at first, taking information from an online video and would instead place more trust in my own doctor. However, I would look into the articles Dr Miles used to substantiate his claims and read them for myself and see how trustworthy they are, as well as looking into other medical journals to see how many concur these ideas. I would also contact my clinician with these concerns to see their perspective, and perhaps ask around if any friends have had experience taking the same medication. I think ultimately I would take the advice of my clinician as they are most aware of what I need."
R_9PRjj1DrQC42Avg,"i don’t trust online doctors right off the bat i’d like take it into consideration but not much beyond that, maybe bc ion care abt the future maybe bc that’s one man’s opinion. If it’s available over the counter it’s probably gonna be fine these things are well tested. I might bring it up to my doctor and see what he thinks and all and if ik someone taking the same medication i’d also question them about it. But that’s all it wouldn’t make me spiral automatically"
R_9n6p2jcdoGyug9Q,A: i need to do more research B: ask their advice/ if they had any exerpience with the drug C: by waying up the pros and cons D: read the articles myself and then evaluate
R_9jGTQ6wMqanivsJ,"A. I would second guess my decision to use medex. B. I wouldn't really ask for any advice from anyone else unless they were a medicial professional. C. I would read the studies, perhaps look more online for reviews, ask my doctor again. D. As question C. Perhaps ask for a second opinion. Look on online forums. If there was any other risk and an alternative drug I would not use medex as there is little risk but high reward."
R_4R3qaCCsYEVJ1wC,"A. Immediate gut reaction would be confusion, maybe slightly scared that that information could be correct, and that i hadn't heard anything at all about liver effects from my doctor. B. Probably nothing - might potentially mention it to my doctor at my next appointment, but wouldn't actively try and contact them outside of that. C. I would definitely do some digging into that article about liver damage, and check if its from a trustworthy journal (peer reviewed etc) and maybe look into what the actual stats were in terms of people who had liver complications. Honeslty, I would probably end up ignoring the video - for 2 main reasons: 1. even if it is correct and there is a chance of liver complications, if my doctor hasn't discussed it i'm sure that chance is incredibly small and not something worth worrying about especially if the medicine is proving effective in treating the headaches. 2. I have no idea what the qualifications of some random dr online are, and would have to do some more research to look into the validity of the journal article. Even if initially i might be slightly scared that i could experience liver complications, i think looking into the stats would reassure me either that this wasn't the case or that it was a very small possibility, so in either case i would probably just proceed with my drs recommended course of treatment."
R_9e43GXStJMzS90J,"When I first saw Dr Miles’ video, I felt confused and a bit anxious. I trust my doctor, but the video was persuasive — especially the part where he showed journal article screenshots. It made me question whether I had been fully informed about Medex. I wouldn’t want to risk long-term liver damage just to treat my headaches. Before jumping to conclusions, I’d message my doctor and say, “Hey, I came across a video claiming Medex can cause long-term liver issues — could we chat about it? Just want to make sure I’m making the right call.” I’d also look up the full articles Dr Miles referenced, not just the snippets shown in the video, to see if the data was taken out of context. To figure out what’s trustworthy, I’d compare what peer-reviewed research says with guidance from official sources like the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) or health.gov.au. I’d also check whether Dr Miles has any conflicts of interest or a history of sensationalising health content online. If his claims hold up under scrutiny, I’d want to know — but if not, I won’t let fear-driven social media posts override medical advice from a qualified clinician who knows my history. Ultimately, I’d delay taking Medex until I can speak with my doctor and verify the claims. It’s not worth the risk of blindly starting or stopping a drug based on a viral post, especially when the medical consensus might say otherwise."
R_45Ae219AVS6KIs1,Not that much surprised since every drugs have side effects. I would say if u have certain disease that coould interact with the drug don't take the medcine and I will ask my clinician about does my other diseases could interact with this drug? To my family I would say use more basic paracetamol or neurofen other than this new drug for a period of time. I would check the medication box and I will check the ingredients in it so that I'm not allergic or have drugs reactions with it. Then I will check side effects profile and efficacy profile. Online clinician is not repuatable enough for me. I will take the medication and I will be the one to decide whether it has very extreme side effects or not because in the end it depends on individual health conditions.
R_9s4teXVhjjfKrPu,"Wait, what? Now I’m supposed to worry about liver damage from Medex? That video is kind of unsettling, especially the medical images and Dr Miles' serious tone. But I also feel a bit skeptical it’s social media, and dramatic health warnings often get clicks. Still, I can’t ignore it completely, especially when it's about long-term effects. I’d probably message my doctor something like, “Hey, I saw a video from Dr Herbert Miles about Medex and liver risks, have you heard anything about this? Should I be concerned?” I trust my doctor and would rather get clarity from someone who knows my specific case, not a general TikTok post. To figure out what’s legit, I’d look up the articles Dr Miles mentioned, if I can find them. Are they from peer-reviewed journals? Are they recent or from obscure sources?"
R_4wv2qYUqkz8tdtv,"Depends on how Dr Miles deliver his video. If it is Mr Beast styled i will take it a lot less seriously. Regardless i'll probably just look at a few comments and go away to look at another video. However, if the video really concerns me, i may inquire on my family and friends who had used medex before. First hand experience is better than whatever someone says online. But if no one i know used medex before, i will inquire a pharmacist (not the doctor i got medex from, its likely he restates whatever he said before). If he supports the doctor, then there's 2 experienced GP vs 1 practice GP, i will take medex. If he supports Dr Miles instead, then i will seek alternatives But it's likely that i will take the medicine anyways without inquire further, people online especially influencers are not reliable sources and will make things up for following"
R_9MJYOtiXLFLwdGm,"Firstly, I would read the articles that Dr Miles cited, as I would have very mixed feelings on the matter - never believe what you see in the media. I would then organise a meeting or message my clinician and link them the video, asking for their advice. I would also consider the liver health of my immediate family, if we have already poor health then I would find an alternative as the risk is too high."
R_9AGePJ73L464Cs5,"i would immediately feel uneasy and anxious. i would probably tell my sister and my friends about it and ask for their thoughts and opinions on whether i would still take the medication or not. my overall gut feeling would tell me to not take it but i think i would ignore it and consume it because at the end of the day it was what my doctor prescribed me after meeting me in person and seeing my symptoms for himself (despite my judgement knowing i probably shouldn’t take the medication). i think after a day or two of consuming the medication as normal, i would be overwhelmed with anxiety of whether or not what i consumed was actually safe, it was probably already lingering in the back of my head for a while as i was taking the medicine. i’d do some more research and would go to another doctor or search up alternative medication i could take instead of that one."
R_9THejfEZJ5ClEBz,"When I first saw Dr. Miles' video, my heart gave a jolt. I was a little scared. He spoke very convincingly, professionally and with pictures and evidence, which made me lose my confidence in Medex all of a sudden. Although it is an over-the-counter drug, he said it might have a long-term impact on the liver, and this is no joke. My first reaction was: Why didn't the doctor mention this to me? Is it that he doesn't know or doesn't take it seriously? Final decision: I won't start taking Medex for now until I confirm that it's really safe for me. It's not that I don't trust doctors, but I think I should have a more comprehensive understanding, especially when there are different voices online. Safety first."
R_9Gt5RTuyE5vjmet,My immediate reaction is to laugh at this guy online as I do doubt it compared to a doctor I see in person and I feel like they would warn me instead or people selling me the drug would warn me. I would probably not mention it to friends or family unless I find it really funny and want to show people listening to an online doctor over person to person interactions. I would probably decide depending on my doctor who I have probably seen many times over my life. The only check or action I would do is probably a google search and reading the box the medication is in. I would probably still take the medication in the end.
R_4JkL95GKekfufeE,I can identify a lot of social media even when given by experts is often shortened or dramatised to reach a far audience. I would go back to my doctor and bring it up with them for their advice
R_9226mr5TyVYQkSJ,"When I saw the video by Dr. Miles, I felt nervous and confused. The idea of long-term liver damage sounded scary, especially since my doctor didn’t mention it. I started to wonder: Did my doctor miss something? Or is the video exaggerating? I sent the video to my doctor and asked, “What do you think about this? Should I be worried?” I also talked to my older sister, who’s a pharmacist. She told me to look at the actual research articles, not just social media posts. So I searched online and found one of the studies Dr. Miles showed. It did mention liver effects, but only in very rare cases with very high doses. I also found that Medex has been approved by medical authorities and used safely by many patients. In the end, I decided to take the medicine, but I will follow the doctor’s instructions carefully and do a liver check-up after a month. I think that’s a balanced and safe choice."
R_9OMQKOT05YB7OWZ,"My immediate reaction would be just a slight concern on whether the medicine side effects could impact me negatively, and call the doctor to probably talk about it in detail, but even then that stage would be unlikely because I don't usually trust popular doctors on social media, as they usually like to clickbait for clout. If I do feel doubt, I would try and check the linked articles in the video for myself first and see if the side effects impacted the majority or the minority, the sample etc, how the experiment or trial was conducted, and why that could be the case. At the end of the day, I would trust a doctor who personally reviewed my symptoms and history over a viral video"
R_4dNq3BiOufhobBG,"My first reaction would probably be to still take the Medex because a lot of online so called ""doctors"" can just be trying to gain attention. I would also ask my sister about the drug as she is a paramedic and my mum as she is a nurse because they would probably know what to do. The doctor who prescribed me the drug is much more reliable as they are from a doctors office that treats many people. I have no idea who the person online is and they could just be googling all the information or even using AI. I may do a little google too but probably wouldn't need because my sister would know. My final decision would be to take the medex as it can help to improve my headaches cus headaches suck."
R_99czvMc8kHQ3LrS,"My emotional gut reaction would be to trust the doctor saying that there are bad side effects. I would immediately go and research myself on the side effects, looking at all sorts of websites and journal articles (preferably scientific ones with real credibility and websites that end in .org or .edu), and I would also probably consult my mum or a family friend who is a doctor and ask their advice. I would also ask to see if any of my friends have taken this before and if they have noticed any side effects."
R_4PStGe5Wwc9r9wn,"Oh no — seriously? I feel my stomach drop a little as I watch Dr Miles’ video. It’s not just someone ranting — he’s calm, he’s got credentials, and he’s citing journal articles. That part grabs me. My first instinct is confusion and a bit of anxiety. My doctor told me Medex was safe and had minimal side effects. I was ready to start it tonight… and now I’m wondering if I’ve missed something big. I screenshot the video and send it to my GP with a short message: “Hey, I saw this online — any thoughts? Just want to double check before I start Medex.” I’m not trying to be disrespectful, but I also want to be sure. At the same time, I message a friend who’s a pharmacist and ask if they’ve heard anything about Medex and liver damage. To sort out who to trust, I ask myself: What’s the source? My GP has seen my full medical history and prescribed Medex based on that. Dr Miles might be legit, but social media doesn’t give the full context. I try to find the actual journal articles mentioned in the video — if I can read the abstract or conclusion myself, I might see if the claims are overblown or cherry-picked. Next, I check the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) site or any government health sources to see what they say about Medex’s side effects. If liver issues were a real risk, I’d expect it to be listed somewhere official, not just in a viral video. In the end, I decide to hold off on taking Medex tonight — not because I’m convinced it’s dangerous, but because I want to clarify things first. I trust my doctor, but I also think it’s responsible to follow up when new information comes up. If my doctor reassures me and the evidence checks out, I’ll start it. But for now, I’d rather be cautious than uncertain."
R_9Cwy2vDo2WFQ4Zc,"of the bat i am already hesitant towards taking any mediacation that messes with my body even if side effects are minor. the video would definetly instill doubt and make me nervous. i think the big quesion for me would be does the pain the medication relieve out way the harm it could cause. i would aslo consult with my doctor (or di my own idependant research) and ask about long-term risks and alternative options. the fact that it is an over the counter drug however does make me a bit more doubtful of the online doctors claims. if this drug was so bad for us, why sell it over the counter?"
R_9VVId9C8Vj2ELgR,"I would immediately feel a bit concerned about the medication. I would not take it until I had more information and felt I could make a better decision. I wouldn't immediately trust Dr Miles as he is online and I cannot validate his credibility or fully trust the advice he provides. I would get a second opinion from another doctor in person and make my decision based on that. I would share my concerns with close family/friends to see if they had been told to take it/what the advice they were given was. Ultimately, I would do my own research, trust my doctors, and base my decision on that rather than a single doctor online."
R_9mIfEpQTVIhg4xA,"I am immediately suspicious of the information stated in the video. Despite his following, I would question his qualifications and sources immediately as it is easy to fake information online. I would the look up papers and consult the medications Australia website to check all reported side effects and cross reference what I find with both what my GP and what the video said. If I was concerned about what I found I would also contact my GP again the next day to discuss what ive found and get there opinion. Ultimately I would wait to start the medication until talking with the GP if I was still concerned."
R_9GldOeU6ucCe2Db,"I would look at the medical journal articles myself, and then try to interpret what they are saying. I would feel slightly worried and torn whether i should use Medex, but I would feel that the doctor I saw is more trustworthy than Dr Herbert Miles, as I believe that the fact that a practising doctor is putting so much time and effort on his social media presence is a bit weird and performative, as if perhaps he does not have the correct intentions or he is not that serious about his job. I would do my own research on Medex, and suggest other medications to my doctor. If he still insists that Medex is what I should take, I would take it."
R_9ux0IL7wacVYq9v,"A. I am really conflicted, because there is cases that both can be right or wrong, either and or, as well as it could depend on the person. Does it pose as long term risk for everyone of particular people with underlying conditions. Research on my own aswell B. Ask supporting friends, family. Research more about it on google, qualified scholars and websites/articles. Asking different GPS, even the health websites. C. Check supporting articles, personal experiences of different people and see if its underlying conditions that could increase the risk. D. If there are any other ways to help with the headaches, other remedities. And if the recurring headaches could be due to lack of hydration, sleep, food, norusihment etc. I would probbaly try different remedities, not fully trusting both sides but approaching it cautiously and also seeing if there are other reasons for my headaches, and other ways to fix it asides from medications"
R_4MbxplCaVt3pXFw,"A. I would feel slightly uneasy about Medex considering the information I know know B. I would ask my parents and friends what they think of Dr Herbert Miles' post, but also ask my clinician if he has any knowledge about potential liver problems associated with Medex. C. I would trust my clinician that Medex is effective and not trust Dr Miles' post, as my clinician would not actively try to do me harm, while Dr Miles' may be spreading misinformation for an ulterior motive on social media. D. I would go and google Medex Ultimately, I would still take the Medex"
R_4MRBxwG8obndACB,"a. i would be a little scared, but realise that the information online can be misconstrued even with data supporting it. b. i might bring it up to my clinician if we meet again, but i would not go out of my way to ask, only if what i found was concerning c. i would fact-check and see other information/data/studies that can prove or contradict what was said by dr miles d. i would then ask my doctor, if my findings support dr miles video and discuss about it. I would ensure I know enough or at least a bit about the drug before consulting/changing it because my doctors decisions should be the best for me."
R_9fAvOKufoGRbRrp,"First and foremost, I trust the professional advice of my attending physician, as he is familiar with my specific situation. Dr. Miles' single warning did not overturn the existing clinical trial evidence and further verification is needed. Headache has affected the quality of life and requires treatment, but caution must be exercised. Regular checks (such as liver function tests) are conducted to actively control potential risks."
R_9Eh6wBy1P9GdA0y,"I would’ve felt very confused as to what to believe, but honestly I would trust the doctor. I would be so thankful to the doctor for warning me and I would’ve chosen to trust him and not take the meds."
R_9EAXEBJRdiCSmK3,"When I first saw Dr. Miles’ video, my immediate reaction was surprise and worry: “Wait, is this true? Could this medicine really harm my liver?” I felt a wave of doubt, because my doctor seemed so confident earlier today that Medex was safe and effective. My first instinct is to send a message to my doctor: “I just saw a video saying Medex could harm the liver—should I be worried?” I’d probably also share it with a close friend and ask, “Have you heard anything like this before?” Before making any decisions, I would try to figure out whether this information is reliable. Social media videos can be misleading, so I would look up the journal articles that Dr. Miles showed in the video to see if they were recent, well-respected studies or taken out of context. I might also check trusted medical websites or call a pharmacy for professional advice. In the end, I would still choose to trust my doctor and start taking Medex, but I would keep monitoring and ask more questions at my next appointment. My decision is based on the fact that my doctor knows my personal health history, while a short social media video doesn’t tell the full scientific story."
R_9UhzOhoJjpcAbBV,"a. ""I should get off this."" ""How much do I need this medication, and how effective is it in stopping my recurring headaches?"" ""Is there another alternative I can take?"" b. I'd ask friends and family for advice; this situation would most likely make me anxious and concerned for my health. I'd also go back to my GP and ask if there is another alternative I can take. c. If it is backed by empirical articles and multiple articles, then yes, it is accurate. d. I'd also do my own research into the medication from client reviews on youtube, Reddit, etc. I would probably get off my medication out of health anxiety fears."
R_9E6o1UR695yWgg2,"I would consider my familial history of liver health and how well my doctor knows my history. I would also do my own research and look at reviews for the medication, as well as trying to determine the likelihood of any liver issues resulting from the medication. I would ask anyone I know if they've had an experience with the medication and but wouldnt message my clinician. Using all available information, I would make my own informed decision on whether or not to take the medication."
R_92XU34cSilT3AQN,"at first i would be concerned. then i will speak to my doctor about this, then i may also ask for a second opinion and find another doctor, as i am aware that sometimes you cant trust everything you see online."
R_9RwGhSUWehXvsi5,"Oh no, why do these things always come up, is my phone listening to everything! I’m actually not one to listen to online docs, so I’m thinking who is this person and why would I listen to them. Let’s do some online research and then book an appointment with my doctor armed with what I have and see what their feedback is. Realistically I’m more likely to follow their advice, especially once challenged further, than someone online."
R_4Y5S3VXplJ1LQNH,"I would initially be a bit sceptical as medical information is being discussed by a person with a large following, they could be presenting the information with the interests of a pharmaceutical company rather than patients. I would likely attempt to do my own research into the article he has discussed as showing the negative impacts of the drug, and also look into any other opinions or perspectives shared online. If i remain concerned about the drug, i would book an appointment with my doctor to discuss my concerns. if the doctor seems to take my concerns seriously, i would be happy to follow their recommendations, whether that is to take Medex or an alternative drug. If they seem to be dismissive, i would consider booking an appointment with another practitioner if i continue to have concerns."
R_4aIWiOxJLzXshwJ,"My immediate gut reaction would be to trust my own doctor, as they know my medical history the best (including reactions/side affects of medications with other meds I am on). I also generally do not trust social media medical advice, as advice varies on individual circumstances - another reason for choosing to take Medex. If I was concerned, I would do my own research on google, and perhaps go to the pharmacy or contact my doctor the next day with any questions. I may also check online to see if Dr Miles has reliable credentials, due to the mixed responses in his comments. I would overall trial Medex for a period of time, therefore trusting my doctor, and regularly test for liver function if I was highly concerned."
R_47BcUqTx8qqGiax,"When I watched Dr. Miles’s video, I felt instantly alarmed. The idea that Medex might cause serious liver damage was shocking, especially since my own doctor had told me it was safe with minimal side effects. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, so I decided to double-check. I searched for the article Miles had cited, and it was indeed real, but the study was based on a small sample and used much higher doses than what I had been prescribed. I also looked up responses from other medical professionals online—some agreed with Miles, but others argued he had exaggerated the risks. To be safe, I called my doctor the next morning. She patiently explained that the liver concerns were extremely rare and mostly related to long-term overuse. She also offered to run regular liver function tests if I was worried. In the end, I chose to take Medex, but more cautiously, under supervision. I valued my doctor’s clinical advice and appreciated her willingness to support me through regular checkups."
R_44HKb6nrJlMLXVL,"A. I definitely would hold on taking the medication, however knowing the reputation online doctor influencers have, I wouldn't be too worried. B. I would re-check with my clinician for sure. As for family and friends, I wouldn't bother asking, because it would just make the situation more confusing, with more mixed opinions. C. I would hold on taking the medication, then do more of my own research. Whether it be patient testimonials, or crowd-sourced questions, such as reddit. I would mainly be looking for long-term reviews and see if they've had any effect, possibly coming from my clinician. D. After doing all of this research by myself, I would most likely still take the medication anyways, considering I personally do not trust online influencers that much, if at all. Considering how mixed the reception of the video was is enough proof for me that it should be fine and these influencers are only spreading misinformation and fear-mongering."
R_4G6rO6u8exqtpAV,"Okay, wow… that video was kind of unsettling. My immediate gut reaction is anxiety — like, have I been misled? I trusted my doctor when they said Medex was safe, and now this GP online is saying there’s a serious risk to my liver? It makes me feel a bit betrayed, like maybe I didn’t ask enough questions at the appointment. But I also know that online videos can sometimes blow things out of proportion for clicks or attention. I’d probably message my doctor — something like: “Hey, I came across a video by Dr Herbert Miles warning about liver damage from Medex. Is there truth to this? Should I be concerned?” I might also ask a pharmacist I trust or check in with a friend who’s studying medicine, just to get more perspectives. As for figuring out what to trust — I’d want to look at the actual journal articles Dr Miles flashed in the video. Are they peer-reviewed? Recent? Are they large-scale human trials or obscure animal studies? And is Dr Miles interpreting them accurately, or cherry-picking scary data? I’d also check what reputable health bodies like the TGA (in Australia) or FDA (if this were the U.S.) have said about Medex. If they haven’t issued any serious warnings, that would give me some reassurance. Before deciding, I’d look for any official responses to Dr Miles’ claims — maybe medical associations or other doctors have weighed in. If it still feels murky, I might ask for an alternative or delay starting the medication until I have clarity. I’d hold off on starting Medex until I get a clearer answer from my doctor. My headaches are recurring, but not urgent enough to risk potential long-term liver damage — if that risk is real. I want confirmation from someone I trust medically, not just an influencer GP online, before putting something in my body regularly."
R_4ZCEWgUy4gJ1QFO,"I would feel scared initially. I would probably look at Dr Herbert Miles' social media profile to see if he is credible or not. Then i would google to see what other people say or what other studies claim. I would then inspect the medicine bottle and look at the information it provides. If it says that the side effects are for a certain group of people such as pregnant/ underage then i would probably go ahead and start taking it. However, if it still looks really suspicious, i would call the doctor/ clinic and ask if there are any safer and more clinically accepted drug alternatives to Medex."
R_9BJxT7iJnxHaxDr,"Whoa, this is a bit unsettling. I was feeling pretty confident about starting Medex — my doctor seemed sure, and said the side effects were minimal. But now, this video from Dr Miles has thrown me off. Long-term liver risk? That’s a big deal. I think I’d first message my GP and ask directly, something like “Hi, I just saw a video from a GP warning about Medex and liver damage, is this something I should be worried about?” I trust my doctor more than a social media post, but I still want to double-check. To figure out what’s trustworthy, I’d look up the actual journal articles shown in the video, if I can. I’d also check what official health bodies like the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) or similar say about Medex. Final decision? I’ll wait until I hear back from my doctor before starting. It’s not worth risking my liver over uncertainty, even if the evidence might be unclear."
R_9YXG5Y4dTM4mSn2,"Whilst I would immediately feel concerned upon reading the article, I know that a lot of information on social media is not fully trustworthy. I would go and read the medical journal articles by the GP and see if the data supports his claim or whether they have been misrepresented. I would then do additional research and see if other trustworthy medical information sites, e.g. medical journals, government websites, have similar warnings to what the GP said, using search terms that both support and oppose the presence of severe side effects. If there is a chance that the GP's advice is true, then I would consult my doctor and a pharmacist about this risk and follow their advice. If they say that this risk is possible, then I would ask for an alternative prescription, otherwise I would continue the prescription if the risk is minimal."
R_9OBJ6XMuIvupbBT,"I would be worried at the chance there is major risks, I would bring it up with the doctor and potentionally a different doctor aswell. Then research myself on side effects before deciding if I would take it or not."
R_41tqrr81pmslC2o,"I’d probably message my doctor first, saying something like: “Hi, I came across a video by Dr Miles warning about liver risks from Medex. Just wondering if this is something I should be worried about?” I might even send them the link and ask for clarification. I’d also ask a close friend or family member if they’ve ever used Medex or heard anything similar, just to see if this is a widely known concern. To figure out who to trust, I’d want to look at the sources. Just because Dr Miles cites medical journals doesn’t mean he’s interpreting them correctly. I’d try to look up the articles myself or check if any official health organisations have addressed these claims. I’d also check whether Dr Miles has a history of sensationalist posts or if he’s generally respected in the field. Final decision: I’d hold off on starting Medex just for now and wait until I hear back from my doctor. It’s not worth jumping in while there’s uncertainty, but I wouldn’t dismiss the prescription entirely either, I just want more clarity before making a fully informed decision."
R_9MXiwwiMAMXAFTb,"? ,!!!! What, is that true? Damn doctor, which guy should i believe in! Anyway, i ll bear the damn headche and stop eating the Medex. Or maybe ill go to the hospital or ph find other medicine tomorrow."
R_410cYNjEF8U3sUw,"This drug seems to be dangerous. It could affect my long-term health, and my liver health. I'm not sure if I can take this drug. I should call the doctor, and ask him about this. If he says it's okay, I might just take it, but if he says that's a risk, I won't take it."
R_41mv5PqgOB4V5eO,"My immediate reaction would be confusion. I would wonder why a popular Doctor would propose such a thing falsely, knowing the data was being misrepresented. However, it could be solely for attention and views, so rather than basing my opinion on this video, I would do additional research and view the articles myself. Initially, I would trust my Doctor, as he isn't doing it for the purpose of attention rather to help me. There are obvious side effects to a lot of medication; however, they may be blown out of proportion for the sole purpose of attention-seeking. So, I would conclude additoonal reseqarch and trust my doctor as there is a difference between their intentions."
R_9S8kFXSoliHXPI0,"I would be lost without knowing what to do. I might send the video to my friends, ask them whether I should trust my doctor or the GP. additionally, I might text the clinic about the information I saw and ask for their opinion. furthermore, I might started googling Medex online and search for its negative effects in order to make my decision on whether to continue consuming. after getting results from google, as well as suggestions from family and friends, I would make my final decision based on them."
R_9ErPXg9B4fMpOaU,"I would feel some what paranoid and disturbed. To reassure myself, I would instead consult to another doctor for better clarification, it's not ideal to rely on every information from social media. I myself don't view social media as a reliable source of information (especially medical information) regardless of the following. Up front (in-person) consultation with a certified doctor is my only reliable source, i can discuss with them about the consequences and bad influences of this medication which I've heard from social media. Rather than leaving those worries unattended, I can discuss with a doctor for them to give better clarification. Most of the time, social media is used to express the extremities of certain scenarios for entertainment, it's best to have it clarified with a professional in person. If the doctor says it's ok to intake the medicine with certain protocols, then I will take Medex."
R_4eWcXmeJCwN6sdV,"I would at first be weary of the infomation. I would check to see if there are other doctors/ gps online that say the same thing, however ultimately I wouldn't be able to determine if the data is being misrepresented or not. I would probably go back or call the orginal doctor and explain the situation and what I am seeing online, and ask them to verify if it is true. If i still was satisified with the answer I would seek a second opinion. I think it would be irresponsible to completely trust a doctor online, however equally irresposnible to blindly trust one opinion (the orginal doctor). I would probably also just do a google search of the medicines name and see what comes up online, however be careful to just read the infomation to help gain a balanced perspective or any questions when speaking to an actual professional."
R_9zVyPAZgzVC56Yp,"This is a sticky one. although the doctor has prescribed me this drug and informed me that it works well, this online guy has told me it poses long-term risks to liver health and has medical journal articles that support his claim. I would first ask my doctor if these claims are true and then read the articles myself or search on google if these articles have any legitimacy behind them. I would trust my doctor the most and if he says those clinical trials were legitamate and it does work well i would take it. But if the internet and the articles have really strong arguments to persuade me, i would probably not take it."
R_4X1cMCJsXh1khRi,"i'll try to find tertiary opinions on that drug and if i know anyone that has used that drug before. i will also try to do more research by myself. as far as i know, there are ,ost likely substitute for most drugs when it comes to common symptoms, like headahce. i will deduce that i may not need to eat strictly just this medicine. so i might look for an alternative."
R_4pzNbMaAStZDdZc,"I would immediately be concerned about the conflicting opinions. I don’t think listening to the comments is helpful, so I probably wouldn’t read too far into them or let them dictate what I do. I would probably go to a pharmacy and let them know about my concerns and use that as a second opinion. If the pharmacist or doctor there agreed with my doctor, I would probably go on to ask friends and family if they had any personal experiences with the drug. If they had, I would trust their opinions and get an idea of what the general consensus is. I think I would ultimately approach my doctor as a final step and express my concerns to them before deciding what to do. I would want my doctor to reassure me about the validity of Dr Miles’ claims and the suitability of the articles he references. If there wasn’t conflicting opinions between the pharmacist, my friends and family and the doctor, I think I would start taking Medex."
R_4d0qm12JJ7lAD6Z,"i would feel rather shocked and betrayed and immediately contact my clinician about these side effects. i would additionally try to do my own research into these medical journal articles and gauge at the reliability of the articles. i would also ask around to see if any of my family and friends have tried the medication before in attempt to gather any first hand information. i would consider the information from my clinician, the articles as well as friends/family before making a decision"
R_98LEQQbG1QLjGs9,"The immediate reaction is concern. If there are reports of Medex being harmful to people and it has been prescribed to me, I'd need to know whatever I could about the drug and its potential effects on the body. I'd let my clinician know about the social media post but I wouldn't immediately agree or disagree with its views. I would only message friends and family after I'm sure that Medex is harmful, if not then there's no reason to let them know. To decide which information is trustworthy I'd determine the veracity of the information Dr Miles relies on by checking whether it comes from credible health institutions, and whether sources like NSW share the same view on Medex. Social media is inherently unreliable, but the information could be true as long as the sources are dependable. I'd check with my clinician and with the sources above before choosing anything."
R_439cnIgNhLdMTUI,"Immediately I would be shocked, because the patient-doctor relationship is built on trust, and if the doctor is not informing me of all the risks, then it undermines the belief in the healthcare system. I would then read into these medical journals that have been cited, investigating if what Dr Miles has said is true or if it is being exaggerated. I would also ask some known people who practice medicine of their opinion before making my own opinion of if the risks are valid. If I make the conclusion they are, then I would make another appointment with my doctor to inform them of my concerns. It is possible that the doctor did not know of the long-term risks of the medicine before prescribing it."
R_4kM44HpIMuSFtsQ,"a) i have never had medication that was mandatory to my health. However, the doctor did not say how long I had to take it for. At first, i would be skeptical as online sources are quite frequently incorrect. b) i would console with my friends and get a second hand opinion from another clinician. It seems like I do not have to take the medicine for that long so i would probably just risk it. c) i would check multiple clinicians and search government websites. This might be a recent finding and I need to do more research d) I would double check the creditability of the social media doctor and what region they are from. different countries have different doses of medicine and levels of danger to their body I would probably still take it, if it doenst go on for that long. I feel like im gonna die early anyway from microplastics so might as well"
R_9RvC2KWwEic82Dm,"My immediate response would be one of shock, feeling uneasy and anxious. As a result of watching the video, I would immediately start questioning my medical choices. After seeing the video, I will likely try to call my GP and discuss the side effects of the medicine further, as well as verify if the information provided in the video is accurate."
R_4FxFPJXtfIewh7W,"I would ask for advice from my friends/family to see what they think. Initially, I would definitely be concerned if I saw Dr Miles saying negative consequences of the drug, due to his large following, and claiming to be a practising GP. Nevertheless, people, particularly 'influencers' (those who make income from posting), on the internet shouldn't be a primary source of information. Therefore, I would do my own research outside of just his video. Depending on how much of this further information is in support or against him, I would form an opinion on the drug from there."
R_41KlBJpdsWwJ4wV,"A. My gut feeling would be worry and frustration. Watching the video would have left me unsettled, almost with a sinking feeling and did my doctor miss something important about Medex? I’d also feel annoyed, wondering why my doctor didn’t bring up any serious risks if they exist. B. I would probably message my doctor straight away if its true and I might also bring it up in the family group chat to see if anyone else has heard of this. C. I know videos like this can go viral even if the claims aren’t fully accurate. D. I wouldn’t take the medication right away. The headaches aren’t urgent, and I’d rather be 100% sure before starting something that might have risks. My decision: I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now and speak to my doctor tomorrow. I want to make the safest choice with the best information before I start the medication."
R_4rVmGuGDOlDTrA8,"Ugh, this is stressful. My first reaction is panic - liver damage sounds terrifying. But then I remember how much medical misinformation gets spread on social media, even by people with credentials. I need to think about this rationally. Dr. Miles might be a real GP, but having a ""large online following"" doesn't make him more credible than my prescribing doctor. Social media incentivises dramatic content that gets engagement. The fact that he's ""warning"" about risks that patients ""aren't informed about"" sounds like typical fear-mongering language. The mixed comments are telling - if other medical professionals are saying the data is misrepresented, that's a red flag. I should look up these journal articles myself rather than trust his interpretation. Are they recent? High-quality studies? Is he showing the full context or just cherry-picked excerpts? My prescribing doctor would have access to comprehensive safety data and prescribing guidelines. They're also accountable to medical boards, unlike social media influencers. I'll ring their surgery tomorrow to discuss liver risks specifically, but I'm not going to panic based on one viral video. Final decision: Start taking Medex as prescribed. My doctor's evidence-based recommendation outweighs a social media video, but I'll follow up to discuss any concerns directly with them."
R_4IcXnJCqG7enIII,"Dr Miles seemed confident, and the medical article screenshots looked legit. But then again… he’s also got a huge online presence, and sometimes people with a following lean into fear-based content to get more engagement. Still, if there is a real risk, I don’t want to ignore it just because I already got a prescription. I think I’d send my doctor a quick message or book a short follow-up. Maybe I'll say “Hi, I came across a video by Dr Herbert Miles claiming that Medex may have long-term liver risks. Just wanted to check if you’re aware of this and whether it’s something I should be worried about?” I’ll hold off on taking Medex until I get a firm answer. I don’t want to overreact to one video, but I also want to make sure I'm making an informed choice, especially since it’s about long-term liver health."
R_4gTwmzU00VQzFGG,Of the bat i would start to feel doubtful of my prescription and would be less inclined to take the medication. Moving forward i would do my own research and raise these concerns with my doctor. I do however notice a couple of red flag in the online doctors claim. For one being an over the counter drug would have to mean it isnt that intense and the mixed reviews underneath the video. However it is fair to say that iw ould be feeling nervous and have some doubts.
R_9SrwGFpW1NuWcTL,At first I would feel worried after taking the medication and then seeing it online to have a bad reputaiton. I would not message any friends or family rather I would go to the doctor taht prescribed me medex and asked for his view. I would however trust clinical trials first as medical journal articles may not have done any empirical researhc of their own or obtained data through their own trials. I would do more background research myself and ask people who have taken medex.
R_4mlxyaZfyHqzoIs,"I am worried that there is scientific information saying that the medication i have been prescribed could be harmful. Is my doctor lazily giving out medication or do they truly believe it is safe for me to take?. I would look at the journal articles myself, discerning whether the tests and authors were reliable. If people online say data is being misrepresented by Dr Herbert Miles, i would look at it myself, maybe the risks don't apply to my age group or physical condition. The research needs to be peer reviewed, and maybe a study has been done into the effectiveness of the medicine and low risk for liver health. I would get a second opinion from an in-person medical professional before continuing. Their response and my individual research would grealty sway my final decision. I would take the medication if it was safe."
R_9D0H2cidGGIgHTk,"Watching Dr. Miles’ video made me uneasy—my doctor said Medex was safe, but now I’m hearing about liver risks. I trust my doctor, but the journal images in the video seem convincing. I’d message my clinician: “Is there any truth to these claims about Medex?” I’d also check reputable medical sites for balanced info. Since comments on the video are mixed, I won’t panic. I’ll wait for my doctor’s response and maybe research the studies Dr. Miles cited. If my headaches stay mild, I’ll delay taking Medex until I’m sure."
R_4ps1aBwfiUlBGgw,A.Thats scary... I don't want to get sick... maybe I should talk to my GP. I'll just do some research quickly... omg let me call my mum. B. I maybe should ask my family and friends; guys have you heard about medex ? Doctor; I seen this doctor say that poses serious long-term risk to liver health this is it true? C. I will decide if this is trustworthy depending on what other people have said about medex
R_3nIZ7fgaHieiBpZ,Id definitaely be very concerned as even if this was said by a small followed doctor this is a health matter. First id keep scrolling on the comments to try grasp if the doctor often says wrong things and look at past videos and their comments too to know more about the doctor. Even if the online doctor wasn't trustworthy id still have some doubt and go ask my doctor. Even before that id probably search it up on google as well and just any other way to keep making sure but overall in terms of trust id probably trust the doctor but also I think who exactly my doctor is matters as well. IF my doctor looks young or perhaps maybe cant speak English very well I think it could lessen the trust I have even if I know doctors are just generally trustworthy. Even the location or wherever the doctor works at will probably have a small impact.
R_43bHQ8gIy43Qqn7,A. Avoid taking the drug for as long as possible until the information I was told is trustworthy B. I would not say anything cause I would not like to bother them with my personal issue. C. I will look further into it either through Google or by asking more trusted GPs. D. Probably another scan for information My decision will be dependant on how successful the information search about the drug is.
R_41jSm6yTj5RoCxr,"I would feel extremely worried and anxious about using the medicine after seeing the post. I would probably ask family members about their experience about the medicine. I might decide to do my own research into other opinions to ensure it is actually true or see what others have to say about the medicine. I might also ask my GP again about the alleged claims and understand why they occur. Finally, I would most likely take the medicine because I was prescribed it by my GP who I trust."
R_9VNIBkBFb8rdq4G,"My immediate reaction is that of more suspicion to Medex than previously held, however I would always fact-check by consulting a knowledgeable third party to examine the source or do so myself. To my clinician, I would ask whether this doctor was appropriately representing the data, and amongst those I care about I may be inclined to express hesitancy, but as aforementioned that has to be analysed. Using sources, checking if studies available support each other and replicate, also examining the involvement of special interests in current evaluations of the product. My final decision is to accept Medex, but constantly revise my belief and pull the plug if there's sufficient evidence of liver damage."
R_9i3WqkbyXzPIOUM,"A. Doubtful of both the doctor and Herbert, but more so towards the latter B. N/A C. Research the side effects of Medex personally D. Gather research from various articles I would verify the information online before making the decision to start taking Medex"
R_4Pk4ukh82fcM9bX,"A. I think Dr Miles could be correct especially if he has evidence from reliable articles B. I would ask if any of my friends or family have used the drug, what they think? and tell them about Dr Miles and his findings C. I would do some more research on my own and decide from there, off of gut instinct I would think Dr Miles is correct D. I would check articles and read the ""mild"" side effects on the box, see what they drug is made of and search these chemicals up to try and understand what they do"
R_9hAOLp1N0EAyxFO,I would feel a bit concerned and question the reliability of both my doctor and the social media video; though I think I would be more inclined to trust my doctor because social media sources can be unreliable. I would double check with my family and my doctor just to be certain and potentially get a second opinion before choosing whether or not to use the medication; I think that ultimately I would also try to look into the medicine as much as I can myself. I think that ultimately I would just go ahead and take the medicine as prescribed and stop taking it if any side effects were to occur.
R_9dRnGUVSL6lM6hl,"When first see dr miles video, honestly, I feel kind of worried. The doctor who gave me made said it was safe,l but now this gp online I stalking about serious liver problem. it makes me feel confused should I trust my own doctor or the guy with all the followers on social media. My first thought is to message my doctor or maybe call the clinic. is this real should I be worried about taking meed? I would probably ask my family if they have heard about this as well.I try to think about which information is more trustworthy. My doctor knows my health history and talked about the official clinical trials. Dr Miles has a lot of followers, but sometimes people online want to get more views. Before I decide, I’d check some other medical websites, maybe look up Medex on the official health authority page, or ask a pharmacist what they think. If there’s still no big warning on trusted sites, and my doctor says it’s safe for me, I would probably start taking Medex as prescribed."
R_41ZtrfyfjJVGLwO,"The first thing I would think to do is show my doctor my findings before proceeding. I’d think “there’s no way that an online doctor is more qualified providing medical advice then my regular, but I’lol make sure with him anyway, especially since the the video is so popular”"
R_9uK9OU4Zgkx3Pxv,"I am immediately sceptical about social media doctors as they engage in fear mongering often and sometimes are not even real doctors. I would tell people around me that ""I will never trust social media doctors over real GPs and I have researched the medication sufficiently on my own to trust it."" I would do my own research around the medical journal articles to draw a conclusion - particularly trusting the peer reviewed ones. Hence, I would probably trust my doctor given that they are more likely to be a qualified GP and have less interest in cherry-picking information than social media doctors do."
R_4K6A3cW1Y4DCpEZ,"My first gut reaction is definitely anxiety I feel a bit blindsided. I trusted what my doctor told me, and now here’s this seemingly reputable GP online saying there’s a serious risk I wasn’t warned about. I feel torn between wanting relief from these awful headaches and not wanting to damage my liver long-term. It’s frustrating and confusing. I’d probably message a close friend or family member and say, “Hey, have you heard anything bad about Medex? Just saw this video and now I’m second-guessing what the doctor said.” I might even screenshot the video and send it to them for their opinion. I don’t fully trust a social media post, even if it’s from a doctor especially if it’s gone viral. But I also don’t want to ignore it. I’d try to look up the articles Dr Miles cited to see if they really support what he’s claiming, and maybe check Medex on the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) website or Healthdirect. I’d also call or message my doctor and say, “I saw this video warning about liver risks with Medex can we talk about whether this is a real concern?” Ultimately, I’d hold off on taking Medex until I’ve spoken to my GP again. I still value their professional opinion, but I want to be better informed. I don’t want to risk my liver health without knowing the full picture."
R_45sFQ1KiRZd5vcZ,"I would definitely feel conflicted in which to who to trust as my immediate gut reaction was confusion, and I wouldn't know what to act upon. I would say to my friends and family to go see an actual doctor in person to inquire about the medication or video. Furthermore, I would also say to them that you shouldn't trust information online at face value, you either should do your own research about who is portraying this information and also the topic in of it itself, should always visit a local GP to inquire. I would trust my doctor."
R_9EAyjcuzWwlSWsB,"I would immediately feel as though my health may have been threatened by introducing the Medex drug; however, I would refrain from taking further doses and stay calm until I do more research. I would contact my clinician and tell them about the situation. I would also go to a different doctor and get a second opinion and see which doctor they correlate more with. A large following will not tell me who is more reliable, whereas looking at the credentials of both doctors will. I will also look deeper into the articles by Dr Herbert Miles and look for any credentials on those articles."
R_98LIgzqqTXmkhm0,"i would definitely be wary and on guard. initially, I'd continue to read the comment's perspectives and get the packaging of the Medex to check the information for myself with the side effects. Next, I'd skim over Dr Miles other videos and the comments to see if the comments change in agreeing or disagreeing. Then I'd search the web on Medex generally, for both reviews and information. If the long-term side effects do pop up more, i might stop taking Medex. Recurring headaches is a common problem that doesn't require specific medication. Therefore, there should be plenty of alternatives to change to. I'd have a finial discussion with the GP for his own perspective but would request changing medication regardless."
R_4LUM6rz4IyYO7mN,"At first, I feel uneasy watching Dr. Miles’ warning—my doctor said Medex was safe, but now this viral video claims serious liver risks. I pause and take a breath, reminding myself that sensational claims often spread faster than balanced facts. My instinct is to message my doctor: *""I just saw concerns about Medex’s liver effects—should I be worried?""* while also searching reputable medical sites to verify Dr. Miles’ claims. I notice his cited studies are real but involve extreme long-term use in high-risk patients, unlike my occasional dosage. The FDA’s website lists no liver warnings, and my doctor replies that the risk is minimal for my prescribed short-term use. After comparing both sides, I decide to trust my doctor’s guidance but will monitor for symptoms and avoid prolonged use. For now, I’ll take Medex as directed—but I’ll stay alert for new data."
R_4G3x7Ipdxkppf60,"take a look at the articles that The Video Doctor presents. See if they are from reputable sources and check the abstract and the discussion if available. Come to a conclusion about what can be objectively said about the medication and see opposing opinions about it to get a full perspective. Fact Check the video doctor and see if there are any controversies wherein he proffers incorrect information, take this into account and make sure you can confirm that he is an actual doctor and still has credentials in the field. After You come to a conclusion, do not immediately accept it. call another doctor to ask whether the medication is legit and finalise your opinion based on your and their perspective. (final decision: check the articles and get a second opinion.)"
R_9QRrJIoDjaTtkjA,"1. I would feel a little triggered that there are such serious side effects of the medication that I was not informed about prior 2. I would check the comments to see how many people relate to the topic, double check with doctor if I do feel anxious (likely not). However, my it wouldn't really change my attitude to take the medication as I would believe in my doctor's personal prescription for me. 3. I trust in people's certification and experience 4. Possibly other people's reviews"
R_4R8X3R31XZPpPUJ,"I felt somewhat suspicious, but I will try and do my own research as well as ask close friends and family of what they think, and ill take in the majority vote as which side it is leaning to. If my close friends and family say that it is fine and they've tried it before I would likely just use it anyway, if they say the opposite I would not, as simple as that."
R_9QD8SaZyhUCSZNv,"I won't take drugs for a headache, just take Panadol and sleep. C, I think it's trustworthy but I'll research about it in free time. I would take panadol first. because its the common drug to take"
R_4xxzZCYZMQA1Fjg,"I think i definitely would be skeptical of Medex as if a famous online doctor is saying it's dangerous, then i should look at the medical journal myself and see if its correct. It's easy to believe information online especially if its supposedly from someone reputable like a doctor online, however its important to check their credentials. I think that i would do my research first before i made a decision about whether Medex was safe to use but i would more skeptical of the online information first."
R_9NVmMfCzK0yrrZn,"I will send this video and the references to the doctor to inquire about the specific situation. If I am only taking the medication for a short period or in an emergency, it does not pose a long-term risk. I will simply take it directly. If I need to take the medication for a long time, I will first propose whether it can be changed to another drug. If there are drugs with lower risks available, I will directly switch to them and disregard the truth. If it is not possible to change the medication, I will consult a specialist doctor instead of believing the general practitioner's professional knowledge in this area. Then, I will ask them to provide me with the latest professional articles for reference. Because the videos and articles posted by general practitioners on the internet might be outdated theories that have been disproven. Finally, if all the evidence indicates that the medication is harmful and I must take it for a long time, I will discuss alternative solutions with a better doctor."
R_9PAVCZ89IcvlfBk,"Wow okay so my doctor may have just lied to my face. Dr Miles seems legit, unlike those 'medical professionals' that claim chia seed water will cure diabetes, I mean they even showed the reliable evidence. I should ask my family and friends whether they think Medex is safe or not. I should also discuss with my clinician if there are any alternative medications in case I choose not to take the medication. I'll look into the articles Dr Miles has shared and find anything that counterargues their findings. The more evidence that supports Dr Miles' claim, the more inclined I am to trust their judgement. I'm choosing not to take Medex since this is serious side-effect that my doctor neglected to tell me about."
R_9nBlIRrmWhtjCPl,"I would be sceptical to take that medicine if a certified doctor on a video is stating that the drug can give you long term liver affects. I would show try doctor the video and ask if this is dangerous or not. It depends on what my doctor says about the drug but nevertheless, I would still be skeptical about taking that specific medicine. I would also ask if there was another drug that I could take."
R_4oIjFTLvhqtZ7UM,I would be shocked. Then I would do my own research to form my opinion and decide which side to take.
R_9zvj7mgXc2CCZKn,"I would be confused then checked for the ingredients they used to make the drug. If I found anything suspicious on the list, I would probably not going to take it as often as it was prescribed. If I found it to be helpful and cause no negative effects to me, then I would tell others not to take what the media says seriously because every human has unique tolerance to such drugs. I would not claim my stance on any sides but be neutral and only consider what is good to my health. One advice I would tell others is, ""Take the positive and think about it alone."""
R_4kppi5Tsg3rTVkZ,"I feel really confusing, because I don't know which information I should trust, and this will deeply influence my health. This is a very important decision. I will share this video to my clinician and ask if it is true. I will also sent the video to my parents then ask their advice. I prefer to trust my clinician, because there is too much fake information on social media, sometimes people post some information only for attract more viewers. I will google Medex by myself to get more information."
R_4lLa3jvZvd4lVpy,"Initial reaciton is not to take Medex due to the long-term serious health effects. Then I would want to do more research into Medex and see if the information is fake or not. Also I would present these concerns to the doctor who presbribed the medication and get his opinion. The source being from social media, I would trust the doctor who prescribed it to me ultimately and continue taking the meds, but definitely raise concerns with the doctor next time I see him."
R_4dudAjdABDb7Msl,"This video is pretty concerning. Will Medex harm my health if I take it? Dr Miles seems very popular and is providing evidence, so he seems trustworthy. But there are still people saying he's lying in the comments. Anyways, wouldn't my own doctor know what's better for me specifically? I should ask them what they think. Maybe I should check if any of my friends or family have taken Medex with negative side effects too. I think I'll also do my own research and look at more journal articles to see whether it poses a real risk. I think my final decision would be to take Medex as my personal doctor proposed it for my own condition."
R_4Oqsqm5fERNfAw0,"A, Initially I would be a bit slightly cautious about the drug, however since I was prescribed the drug by the doctor, I would still consider taking it, especially since not all things on social media can be trusted. B, I might tell my friends about the slightly suspicious drug and ask them for advice on whether to take it or not, but other than that, I don't think I would be suspicious enough to trust a random GP on the internet over my actual physical GP. C, I think that my gut tells me to follow my actual GP over the GP on the internet, as although Dr Miles says that the drug would pose long term risk to liver health, there may be missing details on what exactly causes this risk such as the dosage or the frequency of taking the drug. Also, although he showed images of medical journal articles, it is easy to find academic or trustworthy looking journals on the internet that support any argument. D, I would probably do some quick checks by doing a search on the internet or maybe some forums about the drug, to see if the claims by Dr Miles are true. Also I think that I might look to see if any of the people in my inner circle have tried the drugs and experienced any symptoms. Ultimately, I think that if i was really really worried, I would get a second opinion by a different GP or ask the same GP about these claims."
R_4erpfpI8p1ZfDah,i would be shocked at first that i wasnt informed by my doctor but then read more into the comments and do my own research. if i am still concerned about Medex i will book another doctors appointment with a different doctor and get a second professional opinion. but im sure that my own research will help me understand whether the risk to liver health is real or misrepresented. but i would stop taking Medex until i was sure and confident in the side effects.
R_9mZKOVSC49g5zX3,"The first thing that would come to my mind is ""Medex? Could it cause liver damage? This seems to be what a practicing general practitioner with quite a following said. Is it true? But my doctor didn't say this medicine wouldn't cause much damage, did they?"" 。 I will leave a message for my friends and family saying ""I just read that this medicine called Medex can cause damage to the liver, but my doctor said it doesn't have any obvious harm."" I will also leave a message to my doctor saying ""I saw a practicing general practitioner say that this medicine Medex can damage the liver. Is this true?"" 。 To determine whether this information is true and reliable, one might check whether these journal papers have been published in authoritative journals in the relevant field, such as The Lancet, or to look at the official information regarding this drug. Eventually, I will choose to take the medication after consulting a doctor, because the journal papers mentioned by this blogger have been questioned and their data have been distorted. Moreover, my doctor is aware of my past medical history, but this blogger merely pointed out the potential widespread harm of this drug. In conclusion, if after consulting a doctor and confirming the data, it is confirmed that these data are correct, then Medex can be taken."
R_4Dvwp2rXBfPgWnp,"I would feel annoyed and frustrated, I think I would feel this way as I don't like inconveniences occurring suddenly. Then I would tell my GP about the video by Dr Herbert Miles to see what he says, including about his journal article claims. If my GP is certain that the information is false and that I can take the prescription, I would do my own research based on validity Mr Herbert as a Doctor, and briefly read the journal articles. If I find evidence that he's not very well credited and valid, and the journal articles are misrepresented I would take the prescription. However, if I find out that theres a slight real chance that what he is saying is true I would just not take the evidence. I would also consult this with my mother and see what she says, if she says to just not risk it, I might just as my GP if there is another medication I can take. My final decision would be based on what I said, but I think most likely I would just ask my GP if there is any alternative options as I am not bothered to risk anything, if there is no other options for my headache I might just take the prescription and pray on it."
R_944ny0AxPq31Zip,"A. My heart would drop. I would be very panicked and immediately start scouring the internet for more opinions. B. I would first call/ talk to my mum and mention all the information to her, asking for her opinion, my concerns and what I should do next. I would also book an appointment with my GP, ASAP. I'd bring up the research I found, if there's any reason those wouldn't apply to me. I'd also rant to my friends but mostly as an emotional outlet than looking for serious advice. C. I'd stop taking the medication while I waited to decide (if healthy). In this case, the risks outweigh the benefits too much for me to gamble on whether the video is correct or not unless other research proves it incorrect or irrelevant to me in a definite manner. D. I would try to find similar medication with less risks and see if that's effective. I'd also go to another doctor for a second opinion and bring up my hesitations and worries. My final decision would be to stop using the medication regularly for my headaches and reserving it for if it's ever really bad, at least until more research comes out."
R_4bQ7vkzPuystEuH,"My emotions were confusion and slight worry when I saw Dr. Herbert Miles post a video about the Medexricular process of shipping files using marking annotations A warning or Datasource Forgeries: Don't Pull from MedEX? Medex is not for everybody—I know that and my doctor made sure I did too—but he said Medex works, it was safe with few side effects. I was even beginning to feel optimistic I might be able to control my chronic headaches. However, that it might give you serious long-term liver damage was another story. I decided not to panic. Instead, I looked deeper. Read the article Dr. Miles shared in this video Note that it is actually published in a reputable medical journal For sure I encountered studies like Subramanian et al that did not jive with his claims but he also discovered a study or two that supported the safety of Medex. I message my doctor asking about the long term risks. Seh reagierte prompt und erklärte dass die Daten durch das Video übertrieben wurden, in Wirklichkeit hätten nur sehr wenige Patienten Probleme mit der Leber. I ultimately decided to take the Medex route after giving both points of view a good think, but I made sure to tread lightly. I will undergo biannual liver function tests and potential side effects will be monitored. Yes, in the end I trust my doctor is very competent but also its on me to be aware and take care of myself."
R_4EFJc6lUEDNDi9w,"When I saw the vedio, I might start to question Dr Herbert Miles' identity, because in th online world, it is easy for things to be fabricated or faked. I would probably visit his profile to check his other vedios or see if there is any information about his credentials. After that, I would verify whether the journal articles he cited are accurate. I will try to find the source of the article. I don't doubt the doctor who originally predcribed the medication, but when it comes to health-related matters, I believe it is important to be cautious. So I would choose a reputable hospital and consult a new doctor to ask for another opinion and a new prescription. If the new doctor also recommends the same medication , I would follow the advice and let the matter go. However, if a different drug is prescribed, I would choose the new one and continue to monitor the situation to see if any new evidence comes out."
R_9wubrUCWKLR4c2Y,"my immediate response is that dr miles is right. I would show my clinician the journal articles Dr Miles shared and discuss my concerns with them. I trust both information but believe it is possible the drug is being slightly misrepresented by clinicians due to what I imagine is a fairly slim likelihood of liver problems. I would also perform my own research to bring to my clinician. I believe dr Miles is right, as medication can often be misunderstood and he has medical journal articles to support his claims."
R_9THr3sTh9orw2vF,"I was feeling okay about taking Medex after speaking with my doctor, but now I feel uneasy, even anxious. If there’s a serious long-term risk to my liver, why didn’t my doctor mention it? Is this something new, or did they downplay it? I’d probably send the video to my doctor with a short message like, “Hi, I came across this and wanted to check if there’s any truth to it should I be concerned?” I’d also ask a friend who’s studying medicine what they think, just to get another perspective. To figure out what’s trustworthy, I’d try to find the journal articles Dr Miles shows in his video and look up the actual studies not just screenshots or headlines. I’d also check whether other reputable health organisations, like the TGA or WHO, have issued warnings about Medex. If this were a real concern, I feel like there would be more mainstream coverage or official guidance, not just a social media post. Before starting Medex, I’d wait for a reply from my doctor. If they explain that Dr Miles’ claims are based on outdated or misinterpreted data, and they still recommend the medication, I’d probably go ahead but maybe ask about alternatives too. For now, I decide to hold off taking Medex until I’ve had a proper conversation with my doctor, just to feel confident I’m making the safest choice."
R_4eKgzneBgOcLEid,"I will search for relevant information myself to verify whether this medicine is harmless. At the same time, I will also discuss with the doctor whether there are alternative medicines. I can accept the opinions of both parties, but I cannot trust them completely."
R_9bLnX1BQG4bDWWB,"Immediate reaction would be annoyance, as one would expect a doctor to provide satisfactory treatments almost all of the time. But before deciding to do away with the Medex, I would do a bit more research into the topic. I mightn't be a medical professional, but if my headaches were that much of a bother to me, I would for sure put in the effort to base a justified opinion on solid research. If research leads me not very far, I would simply ask my doctor why there is controversy surrounding this medicine, to which I'd hope there would be a satisfactory answer. I think my decision would be largely predicated off of this last conversation with the doctor, as they are the medical processional after all"
R_4urgxvgc132zoCi,Data can misinterpreted and I know nothing about Dr Miles. People online can sometimes have ulterior motives and I would definitely trust my GP more than I trust Dr Miles. Next time I go in I'd probably still ask my GP about the medicine but would keep taking it. If I was seriously ill I'd definitely take it but maybe if it was less severe I'd hold off at least till I did my own research.
R_9kHvimlWxabzpn3,"I would feel concerned at first but then realise its just a singular post on the internet and it isnt as reliable as it seems. I would not say anything to my clinician, friends or family. I would decide which information is trustworthy by doing my own research online. Ultiamtely, i would probably continue using Medex jsut less often and the next time i buy the product i would as my doctor about the potential for causing liver failure."
R_9zSm0Rtpydxh50L,"I would be shocked, especially if I followed Dr Herbert Miles for a long time. I would immediately look into it, ask my friends / family who work as doctors/ nurses. I would also check many sources and come to a personal conclusion. I will most likely believe Dr Herbert Miles, and maybe show the video to the doctor that prescribed me with it. I would also ensure the doctor that prescribed me is reputable. I would also check if my liver is in good condition, ensuring that if I do take it, the effects would be minimal."
R_9ewvQqcISGg20dM,"a. I get a bit panicked. b. I feel confused because I trust my doctor, but seeing someone online say the medicine might be dangerous makes me worry. I don’t want to make a rushed decision, so I would probably stop and talk to my doctor again to get more information. I might also check whether other professionals agree with the person in the video or if it’s just one opinion. C. When deciding which information is trustworthy, I would look for sources that are backed by research or published by experts. Social media posts can sometimes be misleading or taken out of context, so I would be careful about believing them too quickly. D. Before making a final decision, I would want to know more about any side effects of the medicine, and whether there are alternatives. I might even ask for a second opinion from another doctor. I would probably choose to delay taking the medicine until I feel confident that the benefits outweigh the risks. I want to feel safe and informed before making a decision about my health."
R_9kTCAUflKkIxCMx,"I would probably not be very concerened given the fact that social media is notoriously filled with misinformation (including many forms of pseudoscience). I'd double check by googling and reading the first couple of scientific websites that come out and unless they all strongly caution about the drug, I'd be unlikely to have any concern as there is no reason to trust some online guru over an actual doctor that I know. I also don't give any weight to social media comments as the vast majority of people on it are uneducated and simply just want a platform to voice themselves (whether correct or not) or just want to boost their engagement through controversial takes."
R_4hz1oupZI1VLOKO,"While my immediate emotional reaction would be to distrust the medication, my rational side would come out because I do not tend to trust social media. I would first save the journal articles for later to research. I would then go down the research rabbit hole to truly analyse and understand the data myself. Then I would consult my doctor with the information I've found and ask for more. I would message, ""Hey Dr. [name], I've been reading [medical article] and it says there are concerns with the side effects of Medex? I was wondering if there was more information you could provide me on the basis of these effects."" In the end, I would most likely trust my doctor, as they have my personal medical history and understand me as an individual better than the study. I would ultimately leave it up to the doctor to decide whether the medication would best suit me."
R_40TVJRQSynAT7Gu,"A. I would feel wronged by my doctor and upset that he abused his authority and prescribed a harmful drug to me. B. I don't think I would say anything to my doctor personally, or at least not before reaching out to friends and family with the situation and advice on what I should do. I would probably forward the video to them and explain what happened earlier that day. C. Since there are medical journal articles that support his claim, I'd rather not take the risk and continue to use Medex. D. I would make sure to do my own research to make sure that these articles are a reliable source and not just something he manipulated to suit his audience. I would also try to seek other professional advice, outside of the video and my own doctor. I definitely would not use Medex because of Dr Miles' claims as the long-term effects could be irreversible and could end up costing me more money in the future to maintain."
R_97CH322YiXUy0cp,"My immediate reaction is a blend of irritation and exasperation towards Friend A for raising concerns about potential food poisoning at the eleventh hour. I feel as though they might be trying to create unnecessary drama or disrupt our plans. In response to Friend A, I would likely express surprise at their sudden worry and question why they didn't bring this up earlier during our planning discussions. In determining which information to trust, I would consider the credibility of professional critics' reviews in comparison to random Google reviews mentioning food poisoning incidents. Additionally, I would take into account the overall positive reputation of the restaurant. Before making a final decision, I would promptly search for more recent reviews or news articles about the restaurant to ascertain if there have been any recent food safety issues. Ultimately, I would maintain the original booking at the restaurant. I place more weight on the positive professional reviews and my past positive experiences there than on the last-minute concerns raised by Friend A. I would also monitor everyone's well-being during and after the dinner."
R_9ADm21vJo7nh1VT,"I would be hesitant to continue using the medicine. I would ask my clinician on their thoughts. Although I would trust my clinician more, there are online studies to support Dr Miles claims. I would research myself and ask my clinician before continuing to take the medicine."
R_4iOlrUy7IyRo5DX,"I would immediately be confused. Why would something being sold over the counter have serious ling term health detriments? I'd try my best to find the articles shown by Dr Miles, and conduct my own research. Usually I wouldn't go this far, but this could affect my health so I want to be sure of what Im putting in my body. I think maybe I would start taking the medication, finishing the prescription and then, if they work, return to the doctor to get another script. It would be here were I inquire about Dr Miles and his position, hoping to get some clarity and see if his claims can be debunked. I should not have any reason to doubt the doctor, he is licensed and works at a reputable company. Dr Miles however, I am not sure about the validity of his credentials. I would take the doctor's advice, which most likely would be to continue taking the medication."
R_4aUK0rI5Q5xMv99,"A. Skepticism on both ends. Whilst I don't trust online doctors, if they are citing research papers that I can look at I would definitely feel uneasy about taking the drugs. B. If the risks aren't that big and I am only taking it for a short amount of time, I would consider taking it until our next meeting before messaging anyone. If convenient I would inquire about the clinicians opinion on the research articles that claim negative effects of the drugs. C. By looking at the research and talking to different professions. D. I would probably do some research online, look at a few articles and a few more videos. If there is an online consensus the drug is bad I would talk to my doctor immediately. If there are mixed messages I would still consider talking to my doctor but with not as much haste. D is my final decision."
R_9lztR3uL6egBey2,"The video would make me second guess my choice. However, I trust my doctor, but seeing another GP claim Medex harms the liver makes me want to double-check. I’d probably send the video to my doctor and ask if it’s something to worry about. I’d look up Medex on official health websites to see if liver issues are a known side effect. Until I get a clear answer, I’d hold off on taking it."
R_4Eheu30i18UxWo5,"You can't always trust people on social media, so I would be checking Dr Miles credentials, and also checking the studies summaries themselves to understand how realistic they are; if Dr Miles was taking them out of proportion, if the sample size was small, any limitations, etc. I would also call my clinician or a pharmacist and ask their information/perspective on the drug. It is a newer drug from a clinical trial, and with any drug there will always be possible side effects depending on the person, their lifestyle, etc. I would probably continue taking the drug anyway because I trust my personal clinician firstly, but I would ask a pharmacist about it, also you can't trust everyone on social media."
R_97VvwanVzOGTy6T,"Social media itself often overrepresents misinformation, however if this individual has multiple medical articles backing his claim, his sources are therefore more reputable. I would definitely take this up with my clinician, pressing him about these long term effects which were not mentioned originally. Furthermore I would conduct my own research into the medicine itself to see how it works and how it could potentially contribute to risks of liver health. After further consideration and research, I would personally take the advice of my clinician as social media influencers often spread misinformation or have the ability to skew medical journal article information and take it out of context. My doctor is also considered more trustworthy as they are an individual who I have known for a while therefore more credible in comparison to some Dr on the internet who could also just not be properly qualified. Therefore, I would still take the medicine"
R_9UflZdQoAT9DJQ4,"Once, after seeing Dr Mike's video, I would gain some scepticism relating to the drug, then check online with official websites regarding the drug, since it's important to be aware that online misinformation is extremely common. I would ask my GP at my next appointment to confirm the side effects and my worries, and then confirm any scepticism I have regarding Medex. I would also ask any family or friends who have personally had experiences using the drug and ask for their opinion, how they reacted and how they are going now in terms of liver condition."
R_4TPMkluCQ2DzeWR,"i'd be confused, slightly annoyed at my doctor for not sharing this info, if it is true. annoyed at the online guy if i find that it isn't true. glad that i saw the video. ask my friends if they;ve any experience with medex. ask clinican about these claims. read journal articles myself to determine the answer and to see if the data is being misused. i would read the journal articles myself and do my own research before deciding, however i'd probably lean to trusting my clinican as they are familiar with my health"
R_4jDrMj7MSEYhv6g,"My first emotional reaction was anxiety and confusion. How could two professionals give such different views? I trust my doctor, especially since they referenced clinical trials showing that Medex is safe and effective. But seeing a popular GP online, Dr Miles, warn about serious liver damage definitely made me stop and think. I would message my doctor and say,“Hey, I just saw a video about Medex causing liver issues—can we talk about this before I start taking it?” To decide what to believe, I’d want to see the actual journal articles Dr Miles showed. Are they recent? Are they peer-reviewed? Do they directly relate to the dosage and duration I was prescribed? I’d also search for official statements from medical organisations or government health sites. I might even get a second opinion from another doctor, just to be sure. In the end, if my doctor can explain why the concerns don’t apply to my situation, and if the evidence supports their view, I’d probably still take Medex—but only after that conversation. I want to feel confident and informed, not rushed or blindly trusting either side."
R_9qkbBEEu4LBm4Vh,"When I watched Dr Miles’ video about Medex causing long-term liver damage, I felt worried and unsure who to trust. My doctor had assured me it was safe, so this warning caught me off guard. I’d message my doctor to ask, “I saw a video warning about liver issues with Medex, is that something I should be concerned about?” I wouldn’t stop the medication immediately, but I’d want more information before continuing. To decide who to trust, I’d look up the medical journals Dr Miles referenced and check if they’re peer-reviewed and recent. I’d also consider whether the risks mentioned apply to normal use or extreme cases. Next, I’d book a quick consultation with my doctor to discuss it properly and ask if liver monitoring is needed. Unless I’m shown solid evidence of real risk, I’d keep taking Medex, but I’d do so cautiously and with follow-up checks planned."
R_9LcntUWi1nBzmM6,"A. I would not be overly worried as I am cautious when regarding new information that I am introduced to. I would momentarily question the doctor on the internet and want to check their qualifications. B. I would ask my clinician about it after messaging my mum linking the video and asking for her take. If she agreed I should maybe question it I would then ask the decision. C. Look for qualifications on the page, check for cited sources and comments for any verified doctors replying to the post. I would continue to take the medication in the mean time, wait for the response of my mum, then email my doctor if my mum is worried about it and if I remained nervous about it too."
R_49uZMYwK4FPR2Jv,"I would feel very uneasy knowing that the medicine has potential long term side effects, despite being told by the GP that it has minimal effects. To further discern if the video is reliable, I would definitely review the articles Dr Miles refers to. As well as searching on forums to find first-hand experiences from other individuals who have taken Medex for an extended period of time and their own concerns/effects. If the research reveals that Medex in fact does have potential to have long term effects, I will consult my GP again and ask for alternative medicine. If the research reveals that Medex is relatively harmless, I will continue to take it until I experience negative side effects myself."
R_4s5dRRD2FdMG1BY,A: My immediate reaction will be tha this so called “Medex” may have potential long term side effects which I need to research and firm B: I would message my clinician and telll him torovideme with research backed articles that niceties the the medicine he is offering me safe C: I would decide which information is trust orthodox by doing my own research and ensuring whether the medicine is safe or harmful. I’ll will examine peer-reviewed articles that indicate th health implications of taking “Medex” D: Final checks will consist of trusting own interpretation and consolidating my information will closely related friends or family with a medical background
R_9qYtBzsH2T1JLt7,I would be shocked i would ask the clinician where they sourced their info from i will decide by analysing the sources I will decide whether to take action once i am sure that the info the doctor has provided ar false.
R_42MC2sq8D1AMHgC,"A. I would question the medicine that I was given! I would also question the doctor who gave it to me. B. Ask my doctor why he said what he said which differs so much to the scientific opinion. C. I think both are trust worthy to some degree, but I would like to find out the intention of the doctor saying what he said. Maybe the new research from the findings is new. D. I would ask my doctor about his opinion on the medicine again. Maybe he can reveal something that I would not know"
R_9H2EgGSHs88CCFX,a) confused and a bit worried b) would ask my clinician his opinion after reviewing the video and also discuss with friend or families for their input c) review the paper itself and determine from my own reasoning if the claims are true or not would still take the medication because more likely then not the data and results were limited
R_9ckoGSppiMihfQB,i would probably be a little afraid and then i would happen to contact my clinician again to see if this online doctor is telling the truth or not. Then by doing this i am also able to see what is trustworthy and what is not. Then by doing all thse checks id be ok to continue with the drug.
R_9gKWvGKZjF95Y4x,"I would start taking Medex with this review in consideration; doing the right things like drinking a lot of water and following instructions like eating food if necessary with the medicine for example. I would message the clinician, family and friends to gather more opinions before taking the medicine, I would decide to take it as that’s what was prescribed, unless strong feedback from a range of people against the medicine was received."
R_4DIOFgBmrAWKKl6,"Okay, so your doctor says Medex is safe—works well, only mild side effects—and you trust them. But then Dr. Herbert Miles blows up on social media, warning about serious long-term liver damage from Medex, backing it up with journal images. Now what? Here’s the thing: the actual medical info on Medex (some versions) does show potential for short-term mild increases in liver enzymes—a temporary change that doesn’t necessarily mean serious liver damage, just a sign your liver reacts to the drug Ndrugs . And if you already have liver issues, you’re told to be cautious MedicinesFAQ . But there's no widely reported evidence that Medex causes long-term liver injury when taken properly. What’s more, if Medex-LA (a variant with phenylpropanolamine) raises its own red flags—such as stroke risk—that’s separate from any liver concern Drugs.com . Also, take a step back: yes, some over-the-counter meds can hurt the liver (especially acetaminophen, certain supplements, or chronic use) Verywell Health GoodRx —but Medex isn’t known to be one of the big offenders. So here’s where I’m leaning: your doctor's advice still feels more grounded. The influencer’s claim may stretch it if there's no clear proof of liver harm from Medex long-term. It feels like a case where social media dramatizes risk, not always with nuance. My take? Go ahead and follow your doctor's guidance. But if you’re still shaken, it’s totally cool to ask for a simple liver function test next time you’re at the clinic just to cover your bases."
R_47njEZ9mGdQQAmJ,"i'd probably originally feel a bit scared but then I would try and find the articles that Dr Miles is referencing and read them myself, focusing on the discussion and conclusions, as well as looking at if there were any retractions or arguments against the article when first published. I would then, based off my research, arrange a meeting with my typical GP (and if they weren't the one that prescribed me Medex I would send an email to the doctor which did) and discuss any concerns about the drug and ask them if they believe the consequences outweigh the benefits and if there is any tests (like blood or otherwise) that could be used to keep a track on my symptoms. If my general GP is the doctor who prescribed it to me depending on the results of my research I would seek a separate professional opinion."
R_4WIL6fzUqy0uy2G,"I would be skeptical with Dr Miles as some people might just do it for attention or cause some drama, or even just cherry picking information and claims. I would most likely contact my doctor to ask them about it, however I doubt that would do any good as thing is, the doctor would most likely just go ahead with it and dismiss the other doctors. I might do some research on Dr Miles claims and the articles that he has used to back up his points, but ultimate will likely to trust my doctor over some guy online."
R_4SiwDEt39qYpx6u,"Normally I would read the listed side effects myself before taking any new medicine, noting whether or not what the doctor told me matches, so I would have certain expectations already. Reaction to the video would be just slight concern, there's plenty of grifters who blatantly lie on the internet. The mixed comments are pretty characteristic of BS social media posts. Any comments that clearly explain *how* the data is being misrepresented would most likely convince me to ignore Dr Miles. If this Dr Miles is trying to sell some kind of health product in the video or on his profile, I would completely disregard everything he says and take the Medex as my doctor directed. If I'm still curious or concerned I'd go read the Medex Wikipedia article for an overview of how it works and what it does, and whether there's any other obvious important information I didn't get. If Wikipedia didn't mention anything about real possible or claimed serious side effects, I might go and check out those journal articles myself (since my university gets me access to most journals). Just reading the article abstracts would likely be enough to completely disprove what Dr Miles is saying. If the journal articles really do support Dr Miles' claim I would discuss it with my doctor again before deciding whether to take it. If Dr Miles' video is clearly BS I would have nothing to say about it to anyone, unless a friend or family member saw it themself and got concerned, in which case I would explain how I determined that it's nonsense."
R_9DqIf4wJEjv36cP,"I would initially brush it off, as I do not trust all information and sources I get from social media. I have never heard of a Dr herbet miles, and have no verification of his qualifications either which gives me no reason to trust his arguments. However, if i was curious, I would go back to my doctor and show him the social media post, in order to verify whether what Dr Miles says was true or not"
R_9dugL9haczQVFjn,Maybe I should double check before doing this I would speak to multiple clinicians and get their thoughts on the medication I would speak to other patients who have been on the medication for a long period of time and get to know the effects it had on them. My final decision would be to inform my doctor I would like to hold off until I have all the information
R_9h5u12dwC5eG2Z6,"When I first watch Dr Miles’s video, my immediate reaction is concern — the phrase “serious long-term risk to liver health” feels alarming, especially when paired with medical journal images. At the same time, I feel a degree of scepticism; dramatic online warnings often attract attention, and I know that context can be missing or misrepresented. My instinct is to message my doctor before making any decision: “I’ve just seen a video from Dr Herbert Miles claiming Medex causes long-term liver damage. Could you please confirm whether this is accurate and if it changes your recommendation?” I might also share the link so they can review the exact content. To decide whose information is more trustworthy, I would look at the original studies Dr Miles cites — checking whether they are peer-reviewed, how large the sample sizes are, and whether conclusions match his claims. I would also research official health authority statements and consult reputable medical websites for balanced summaries. Before starting the medication, I would also consider arranging a second opinion, ideally from another GP or pharmacist, to see if there is any consensus. My final decision would be to delay starting Medex until I receive clarification from my doctor and can confirm whether the safety concerns are legitimate. The potential health risk — if true — outweighs the cost of a short delay, and I prefer to act on confirmed, professional advice rather than potentially misleading online content."
R_9GDETN8lfI96G4x,"**Thinking Aloud (Medex Decision-Making):** Wow, that video was intense. My first reaction? Worry. I trusted my doctor when she said Medex was safe with only mild side effects. Now this well-known GP online is saying it could harm my liver long-term? That’s not something I can ignore, especially when he even showed medical journal screenshots. But then again… people in the comments are saying the data might be exaggerated or taken out of context. That makes me question it too. I think I’d text my doctor or maybe book a quick call: *“Hey, I just saw a post from Dr Miles about Medex and liver risks. Should I be concerned?”* I don’t want to sound like I’m doubting her—but I also want to make an informed decision. I’d also look up the studies Dr Miles referenced, check if they’re recent, peer-reviewed, and whether the risks were long-term and under what dosage. To be honest, I don’t fully trust viral social media posts, even if they come from doctors. Information without proper context can easily be misused. So, until I speak to my doctor and maybe even get a second opinion or check my liver history, I’ll hold off on taking Medex. My health is worth double-checking. Final decision: pause and verify before taking."
R_9PvWDImxOitPjFi,"Neutral emotion, i trust that my own doctor would be well informed on a drug they are prescribing. If the claims are backed by genuine research I would conduct my own research and if the information found made me more anxious I would consult my doctor directly about my concerns for reassurance."
R_4lSNZLsjvNgORxZ,"People online should not be trusted, but it is never not safe to be sure. I should check again with a doctor in person as they are a far more reputable source than any online celebrity."
R_4s0LyD7vCcmzXcA,"I will question the effect and side effects of the drug. I will ask my doctor about the specific information of the drug, and I will ask several professionals about the analysis of various data of the drug to determine whether the drug is safe and suitable for the treatment of my disease."
R_4Yh9KMaB7T35VHH,"okay i'd be a little worried but my doctor knows my medical condition more than someone else. the majority doens't represent me always. i'd look it up online to see what the misrepresentation comments are talking about, if there are any forums of people talking about it and how it positively affected him, and dr miles' reliability. i know a lot of internet doctors arent reliable even if they went to med school. i see if i can book a short appointment w the doctor to talk about it. if not, i'll ask the pharmacist. ultimately i will take the meds"
R_4PRyBwd0Rj1hXAv,I would do suddenly doubt the medicine I got and do my own research. I would also seek out other medical professionals and ask for their opinions. I would also make sure that the medical journal articles that were used to support his claim were peer reviewed and real. However Dr Miles has stated that it COULD pose serious long-term risks to liver health and without a definitive answer yet I would hold off taken the drug.
R_4oYj8hpyfzkL4qd,My immediate reaction would be concerned and unwilling to take the medication. I’d try to look up the studies he showed and check if any health sites or official pages warn about Medex. I’d want to hear my doctor’s explanation before taking it. I’d wait to start Medex until I’ve talked to my GP and checked the info myself. Better to be safe than sorry.
R_9ysX3HF7qQg4tjz,"Watching that video by Dr. Miles, my heart instantly sank. The doctor clearly said Medex has really mild side effects, so where did this sudden talk of long-term liver damage come from? My mind was a mess—if I don't take it, I'm scared the headaches will keep coming nonstop; but if I do take it, I'm worried it'll really mess up my liver. This conflicting, anxious feeling is just awful. I send my doctor a message right away. I'll say, ""Doc, I just saw Dr. Miles saying Medex has a serious long-term risk to the liver, and he even attached pics of medical journal articles. That's not what you told me before, and I'm kinda worried. Wondering what's going on here?"" Also, I wanna chat with my friend who's a doctor, ask if she knows anything about Dr. Miles or those journal articles he mentioned. Figuring out if this info is trustworthy takes some thinking. The doctor recommended it based on clinical trial results. Clinical trials are usually strictly designed and monitored, with a pretty big sample size, so their results should be pretty reliable. Dr. Miles is a practicing GP with lots of followers, but you can't just take his word for it alone. Those medical journal articles he talked about—gotta check if they're published in reputable journals, if the study's sample size and design are scientific, and if the conclusions are backed up by enough data. Plus, some comments say the data was twisted, so that's worth noting—maybe he took things out of context. Before I decide, I need to do some checks and take action. First, try to find the original medical journal articles Dr. Miles showed, read them carefully, and see if the study's details and conclusions are really like he said. Second, check Medex's package insert to see if it mentions anything about long-term liver risks. Besides that, look up other authoritative medical websites or databases to see if there are more studies and reports on Medex's long-term side effects. In the end, I decided not to rush into taking Medex. I'll wait until I've verified all this info and had a good chat with the doctor before making up my mind. After all, this is about my health, especially an important organ like the liver. Can't be careless—gotta get a clear picture of the risks first."
R_4EGgUEbaGhlE4RE,"I would be questioning it when the doctor first time mentioned clinical trials -- since I think not being in the medical field that connotation does not seemed guaranteed. When I hear about Dr Herbert's video, I would immediately be concerned and would definitely start researching other common medicine for my sickness. I would think that since this is regarding my health, I would not want to risk anything and just take something more common that has been proven for years instead of choosing which party to trust."
R_9cSz6xO81NhYah9,"Hmmm what do I do, do I start taking this medicine or not im not sure if I want to trust dr mile's opinion how do i know its true or not let me ask my doctor. hey doctor do you think i can switch to a different medicine as Medex is said to pose serious long term risks to liver health and im sure there are other medicines i could take for my headaches that dont have implications on my liver health. i would tell my friends or family to be wary about Medex and to find an alternative if possible just in case the information is true. i would take both opinions to a real pharmacist and ask them which opinion is true before deciding if i should take Medex or not. my final decision depends on the pharmacist and will either be a yes or no."
R_4mWWreCcbAYAgcr,"1) worry b) maybe talk to my dr about the video and express my concerns c) read the articles d) talk to my dr again, maybe see a new dr for another perspective i wouldn't immediately take the medicine if i was having doubts but would continue to look into it instead of blindly trusting an online source."
R_9pZ4VmJn5WPju4M,"When I first watched Dr Miles’s video, I felt alarmed and confused. My doctor had reassured me that Medex was safe with only mild side effects, yet here was another medical professional warning about serious liver risks. I immediately thought about my health history and wondered if I might be particularly vulnerable. I would message my doctor or pharmacist straight away, summarising Dr Miles’s claims and asking for their professional opinion. To decide whose information is more trustworthy, I’d check the credibility of both sources: my prescribing doctor knows my medical history, while Dr Miles’s post might be aimed at the general public. I’d also look up the medical journals he referenced, verify if the studies were peer-reviewed, recent, and relevant to typical Medex dosages. Before making a decision, I’d seek a second medical opinion and possibly request liver function tests if I decide to proceed with the medication. My final decision would be to delay starting Medex until I get professional clarification, because protecting my long-term health outweighs the urgency of treating my headaches."
R_97APSd1kYg20UmZ,"A. I am surprised that the healthcare system would allow a drug which harsh long term effects without warning. The video would have really surprised me. B. I would ask my clinician if the claims in the video are true and demand an explanation from the claims. I would maybe ask my friends and family their thoughts on the matter. Before doing this I would be pragmatic and do some of my own research first. C. Ensuring you look for the side with scientific evidence is important, but also ensuring that the evidence is not manipulated is key. I would ensure that i do research on both sides of the argument and accumulate evidence and then from their judge the final results. D. I would check the credentials of the online GP and particularly the paper he is using to refute the use of the drug. I would trust my practicing clinician over the online GP due to the fact that the data in an online paper can be easily manipulated."
R_4hpIVUPRHVc2sCt,"My immediate reaction would be to stop taking it (depending on whether it was a medication that could be stopped without taper or anything - either way I would start research immediately) I would begin with searching the medication online, and seeing what the general consensus was - if it seemed like Dr Miles was the only media coming up, and other articles seemed to think it was fine I would probably ignore it/bring it up with my regular doctor at our next appointment, but not specifically make an appointment to ask. If most things did seem to say it could lead to liver failure, I would probably stop taking it and research other medications that can help with headaches that do not have these side effects, and bring it up with my doctor the next time I went, both to ask their opinion on the media, and to ask about alternatives I could try."
R_9fA6B5uPjcqDdWF,"A. I'd probably be wary, but take into account that what people say in social media are not always true. B. I wouldn't say anything unless there are several pointed studies that actually prove this, but I'd send the post to my family/friends to tell them not to use it until proven otherwise. C. Medical reports/studies that have been done by trustworthy resources and companies. Since people can say whatever they want in social media. D. I'd probably not take Medex at this point if it is a fairly newly found drug, but if it's been proven in time that it isn't harmful according to trusthworthy reports, then I'll keep using it."
