I am immediately sceptical about social media doctors as they engage in fear mongering often and sometimes are not even real doctors. I would tell people around me that "I will never trust social media doctors over real GPs and I have researched the medication sufficiently on my own to trust it." I would do my own research around the medical journal articles to draw a conclusion - particularly trusting the peer reviewed ones. Hence, I would probably trust my doctor given that they are more likely to be a qualified GP and have less interest in cherry-picking information than social media doctors do.
