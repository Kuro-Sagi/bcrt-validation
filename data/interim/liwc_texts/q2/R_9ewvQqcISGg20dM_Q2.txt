a. I get a bit panicked.
b. I feel confused because I trust my doctor, but seeing someone online say the medicine might be dangerous makes me worry. I don’t want to make a rushed decision, so I would probably stop and talk to my doctor again to get more information. I might also check whether other professionals agree with the person in the video or if it’s just one opinion.
C. When deciding which information is trustworthy, I would look for sources that are backed by research or published by experts. Social media posts can sometimes be misleading or taken out of context, so I would be careful about believing them too quickly.
D. Before making a final decision, I would want to know more about any side effects of the medicine, and whether there are alternatives. I might even ask for a second opinion from another doctor.
 I would probably choose to delay taking the medicine until I feel confident that the benefits outweigh the risks. I want to feel safe and informed before making a decision about my health.
