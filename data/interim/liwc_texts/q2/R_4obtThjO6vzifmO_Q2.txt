A. Speculation. I hope this side effect doesn't affect me 

B. I would text my clinician that i'll test it out for a few weeks and if I experience anything i'm immediately not taking the medication any more. I'll take my chances with panadol. I would also tell my mother, father and sisters.

c. Take everything with a grain of salt. Remember both the good reviews and the bad. Hope for a good reaction 

D. I would do no checks besides opening tiktok and searching results and peoples experiences with the medication. Then i'll take it myself and see how I go.
