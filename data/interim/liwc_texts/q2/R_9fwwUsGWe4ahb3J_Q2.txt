Immediately I would feel nervous and distressed about the risk of liver issues. I would immediately contact family and close friends to ask if they know anyone else taking Medex and if they know of the liver side effects. If their response supports the online doctor I would contact my clinician and question them about the liver effects and ask for an alternative. I would be sceptical about the social media doctor, as often they post controversial information in order to boost their views and income. Ultimately I think I would ask my clinician for an alternative as their are often many drugs available for headaches.
