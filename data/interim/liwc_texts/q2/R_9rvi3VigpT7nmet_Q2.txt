Watching Dr. Herbert Miles' video gives me an immediate sense of uncertainty and anxiety. The idea that Medex, which I’ve just been prescribed for headaches, could harm my liver is alarming, especially since the doctor mentioned minimal side effects. The images of medical journals he shows look convincing, but I don’t know if the data is being presented in the right context. My gut reaction is to feel a bit scared, but also skeptical because it feels like a lot of health claims on social media are often exaggerated or misleading.

I’d message my doctor right away to ask if they’re aware of any potential liver risks with Medex. I’d also talk to friends or family who are more knowledgeable about medications to get their perspective. I’d want to make sure the information I’m getting is well-rounded, so I’d also do some research myself, looking at reputable medical sources and possibly asking for a second opinion from another healthcare professional.

To decide which information is trustworthy, I’d prioritise sources like peer-reviewed journal articles, government health websites, and medical professionals over social media posts. I’d also cross-check Dr. Miles' claims with the package insert or official details on the medication.

In the end, my final decision would depend on the answers I get from my doctor and my own research. If the liver risk claims are confirmed, I might reconsider taking Medex or explore alternative treatments. However, if my doctor reassures me with scientific evidence, I’d likely proceed with the medication.
