I would feel very uneasy knowing that the medicine has potential long term side effects, despite being told by the GP that it has minimal effects. To further discern if the video is reliable, I would definitely review the articles Dr Miles refers to. As well as searching on forums to find first-hand experiences from other individuals who have taken Medex for an extended period of time and their own concerns/effects. If the research reveals that Medex in fact does have potential to have long term effects, I will consult my GP again and ask for alternative medicine. If the research reveals that Medex is relatively harmless, I will continue to take it until I experience negative side effects myself.
