A. I am surprised that the healthcare system would allow a drug which harsh long term effects without warning. The video would have really surprised me.

B. I would ask my clinician if the claims in the video are true and demand an explanation from the claims. I would maybe ask my friends and family their thoughts on the matter. Before doing this I would be pragmatic and do some of my own research first. 

C. Ensuring you look for the side with scientific evidence is important, but also ensuring that the evidence is not manipulated is key. I would ensure that i do research on both sides of the argument and accumulate evidence and then from their judge the final results. 

D. I would check the credentials of the online GP and particularly the paper he is using to refute the use of the drug.

I would trust my practicing clinician over the online GP due to the fact that the data in an online paper can be easily manipulated.
