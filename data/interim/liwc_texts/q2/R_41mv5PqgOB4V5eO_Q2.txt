My immediate reaction would be confusion. I would wonder why a popular Doctor would propose such a thing falsely, knowing the data was being misrepresented. However, it could be solely for attention and views, so rather than basing my opinion on this video, I would do additional research and view the articles myself. Initially, I would trust my Doctor, as he isn't doing it for the purpose of attention rather to help me. There are obvious side effects to a lot of medication; however, they may be blown out of proportion for the sole purpose of attention-seeking. So, I would conclude additoonal reseqarch and trust my doctor as there is a difference between their intentions.
