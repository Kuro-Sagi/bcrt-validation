I would distrust the video as plenty of posts on social media are designed with the algorithm in mind and there is rarely critical analysis of information even if it may appear true on the surface. I wouldn't contact anyone, I would find the journal articles he mentioned and read them myself. If i struggled to understand them then I would reach out to my doctor and bring the articles with me. I would carefully analyse the information as much as I could before making a decision however I absolutely would lean towards trusting my own doctor assuming I've been with them for a long time. Assuming I can't find anything major, I would take the medication.
