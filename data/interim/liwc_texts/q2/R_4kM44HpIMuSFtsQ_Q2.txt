a) i have never had medication that was mandatory to my health. However, the doctor did not say how long I had to take it for. At first, i would be skeptical as online sources are quite frequently incorrect. 
b) i would console with my friends and get a second hand opinion from another clinician. It seems like I do not have to take the medicine for that long so i would probably just risk it. 
c) i would check multiple clinicians and search government websites. This might be a recent finding and I need to do more research
d) I would double check the creditability of the social media doctor and what region they are from. different countries have different doses of medicine and levels of danger to their body

I would probably still take it, if it doenst go on for that long. I feel like im gonna die early anyway from microplastics so might as well
