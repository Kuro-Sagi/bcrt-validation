Liver damage? That’s not what my doctor said at all. This is kind of scary. I was feeling okay about taking Medex, especially since my doctor seemed confident it was safe and even said side effects were mild. But now I’m seeing this video from Dr Miles and he’s an actual GP with journal articles backing him up? I don’t want to mess around with my liver, especially if there’s a real risk.

At the same time, I know social media can blow things out of proportion. Just because someone has a big following doesn't mean everything they say is balanced or up to date. Still, it makes me hesitate. I think I’ll message my doctor and ask directly about what Dr Miles said maybe even include a link to the video. Something like, “Hi, I came across this post saying Medex could have serious long-term effects on the liver. Is this something I should be worried about?”

I’ll also check the official health websites like the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) or even look up the medical articles Dr Miles flashed on screen, if I can find them. If the articles are real and recent, that might mean there's more to this than what my doctor first told me. I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now, at least until I’ve cleared this up properly. I’d rather deal with a headache than unknowingly risk something worse.
