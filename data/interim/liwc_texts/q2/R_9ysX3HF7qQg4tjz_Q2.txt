Watching that video by Dr. Miles, my heart instantly sank.  The doctor clearly said Medex has really mild side effects, so where did this sudden talk of long-term liver damage come from? My mind was a mess—if I don't take it, I'm scared the headaches will keep coming nonstop;  but if I do take it, I'm worried it'll really mess up my liver.  This conflicting, anxious feeling is just awful.
I send my doctor a message right away.  I'll say, "Doc, I just saw Dr. Miles saying Medex has a serious long-term risk to the liver, and he even attached pics of medical journal articles.  That's not what you told me before, and I'm kinda worried.  Wondering what's going on here?"  Also, I wanna chat with my friend who's a doctor, ask if she knows anything about Dr. Miles or those journal articles he mentioned.
Figuring out if this info is trustworthy takes some thinking.  The doctor recommended it based on clinical trial results.  Clinical trials are usually strictly designed and monitored, with a pretty big sample size, so their results should be pretty reliable.  Dr. Miles is a practicing GP with lots of followers, but you can't just take his word for it alone.  Those medical journal articles he talked about—gotta check if they're published in reputable journals, if the study's sample size and design are scientific, and if the conclusions are backed up by enough data.  Plus, some comments say the data was twisted, so that's worth noting—maybe he took things out of context.
Before I decide, I need to do some checks and take action.  First, try to find the original medical journal articles Dr. Miles showed, read them carefully, and see if the study's details and conclusions are really like he said.  Second, check Medex's package insert to see if it mentions anything about long-term liver risks.  Besides that, look up other authoritative medical websites or databases to see if there are more studies and reports on Medex's long-term side effects.
In the end, I decided not to rush into taking Medex.  I'll wait until I've verified all this info and had a good chat with the doctor before making up my mind.  After all, this is about my health, especially an important organ like the liver.  Can't be careless—gotta get a clear picture of the risks first.
