At first I would feel disappointed or frustrated that my doctor did not specify what the mild side effects were. I would present my concerns with my doctor, and try to address all my concerns. If my concerns are not addressed in a manner that makes me assured, I would check the medical journal articles that Dr Herbert Miles listed and make a judgement based on the reliability of those articles. If I deem it necessary, I would not take the medication prescribed by my doctor, especially if I have any lingering concerns. I prefer not to entertain any risks, especially when taking any prescribed drugs, as I have had negative experiences with medication in the past.
