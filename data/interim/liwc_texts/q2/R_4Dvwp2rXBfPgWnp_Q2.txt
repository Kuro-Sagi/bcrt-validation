I would feel annoyed and frustrated, I think I would feel this way as I don't like inconveniences occurring suddenly. Then I would tell my GP about the video by Dr Herbert Miles to see what he says, including about his journal article claims. If my GP is certain that the information is false and that I can take the prescription, I would do my own research based on validity Mr Herbert as a Doctor, and briefly read the journal articles. If I find evidence that he's not very well credited and valid, and the journal articles are misrepresented I would take the prescription. However, if I find out that theres a slight real chance that what he is saying is true I would just not take the evidence. I would also consult this with my mother and see what she says, if she says to just not risk it, I might just as my GP if there is another medication I can take. My final decision would be based on what I said, but I think most likely I would just ask my GP if there is any alternative options as I am not bothered to risk anything, if there is no other options for my headache I might just take the prescription and pray on it.
