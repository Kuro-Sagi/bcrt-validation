A id definitely be concerned and immediately trust dr herbert miles but then id come to my sense and try to find more research
B id tell them about what i found and what i should do
C id rather trust dr herbert miles than the doctor prescribing because its better to not take something than to take something - consider different options e.g. ibuprofen or paracetamol
D - id definitely research before hand to see how many findings dr miles has gotten from it and if anyone else has similar views

but id still not take the drug because its better not to induce more harmful symptoms than have a headache
