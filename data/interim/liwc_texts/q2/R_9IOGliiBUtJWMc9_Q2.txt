At first I think I would be very anxious deciding whether to take the medicine and I consider I would be much careful that I would immediately surf on the Internet for more information and have a simple judgement. And personally I would trust the doctor more than the media influencer so I think I would probably make a call and ask him for further details about the medicine.If I couldn't figure out which statement is more reliable I would rather not to take it to ensure my body health but to look for other ways to cure headache.
