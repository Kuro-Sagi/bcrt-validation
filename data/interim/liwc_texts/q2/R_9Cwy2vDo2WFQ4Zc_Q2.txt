of the bat i am already hesitant towards taking any mediacation that messes with my body even if side effects are minor. 
the video would definetly instill doubt and make me nervous. i think the big quesion for me would be does the pain the medication relieve out way the harm it could cause. i would aslo consult with my doctor (or di my own idependant research) and ask about long-term risks and  alternative options. the fact that it is an over the counter drug however does make me a bit more doubtful of the online doctors claims. if this drug was so bad for us, why sell it over the counter?
