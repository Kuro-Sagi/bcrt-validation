A= my immediate thought is that Dr Herbert Miles could have his own agenda. He might be bad mouthing a medication in order to promote a different one. Also, some side effects are only applicable to certain patients with pre-existing medical issues, so the majority of people will be fine and your GP knows your history anyway so they wouldn't recommend it to you knowing you are at risk.
B= I wouldn't say anything.
C= I'd stick with my GP, he knows my medical history and wouldn't purposfully give me something that could do more damage.
D= I would check to see how/why it causes liver damage according to the papers.
I would take it because I don't know if the tiktoker has an alterior motive.
