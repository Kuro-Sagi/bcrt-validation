Of the bat i would start to feel doubtful of my prescription and would be less inclined to take the medication. Moving forward i would do my own research and raise these concerns with my doctor. I do however notice a couple of red flag in the online doctors claim. For one being an over the counter drug would have to mean it isnt that intense and the mixed reviews underneath the video. However it is fair to say that iw ould be feeling nervous and have some doubts.
