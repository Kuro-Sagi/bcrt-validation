Id definitaely be very concerned as even if this was said by a small followed doctor this is a health matter. First id keep scrolling on the comments to try grasp if the doctor often says wrong things and look at past videos and their comments too to know more about the doctor. Even if the online doctor wasn't trustworthy id still have some doubt and go ask my doctor. Even before that id probably search it up on google as well and just any other way to keep making sure but overall in terms of trust id probably trust the doctor but also I think who exactly my doctor is matters as well. IF my doctor looks young or perhaps maybe cant speak English very well I think it could lessen the trust I have even if I know doctors are just generally trustworthy. Even the location or wherever the doctor works at will probably have a small impact.
