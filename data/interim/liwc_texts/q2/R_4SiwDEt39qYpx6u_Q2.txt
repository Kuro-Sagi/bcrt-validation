Normally I would read the listed side effects myself before taking any new medicine, noting whether or not what the doctor told me matches, so I would have certain expectations already.

Reaction to the video would be just slight concern, there's plenty of grifters who blatantly lie on the internet. The mixed comments are pretty characteristic of BS social media posts. Any comments that clearly explain *how* the data is being misrepresented would most likely convince me to ignore Dr Miles.

If this Dr Miles is trying to sell some kind of health product in the video or on his profile, I would completely disregard everything he says and take the Medex as my doctor directed.

If I'm still curious or concerned I'd go read the Medex Wikipedia article for an overview of how it works and what it does, and whether there's any other obvious important information I didn't get.

If Wikipedia didn't mention anything about real possible or claimed serious side effects, I might go and check out those journal articles myself (since my university gets me access to most journals). Just reading the article abstracts would likely be enough to completely disprove what Dr Miles is saying.

If the journal articles really do support Dr Miles' claim I would discuss it with my doctor again before deciding whether to take it.

If Dr Miles' video is clearly BS I would have nothing to say about it to anyone, unless a friend or family member saw it themself and got concerned, in which case I would explain how I determined that it's nonsense.
