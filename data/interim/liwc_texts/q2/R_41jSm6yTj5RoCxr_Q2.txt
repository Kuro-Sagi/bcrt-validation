I would feel extremely worried and anxious about using the medicine after seeing the post. I would probably ask family members about their experience about the medicine. I might decide to do my own research into other opinions to ensure it is actually true or see what others have to say about the medicine. I might also ask my GP again about the alleged claims and understand why they occur. Finally, I would most likely take the medicine because I was prescribed it by my GP who I trust.
