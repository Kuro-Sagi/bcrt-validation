is the doctor prescribing medex a reliable doctor according to others? if so, or if they've been a family doctor for years, i would take the medex, since the GP's data, according to some people, is being misrepresented. although, is it worth the potential of serious long-term liver issues, which data may be showing. i think i would prefer to find a different drug or deal with headaches than have liver issues in the future
