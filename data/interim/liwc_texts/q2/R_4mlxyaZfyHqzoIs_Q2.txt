I am worried that there is scientific information saying that the medication i have been prescribed could be harmful. Is my doctor lazily giving out medication or do they truly believe it is safe for me to take?. I would look at the journal articles myself, discerning whether the tests and authors were reliable. If people online say data is being misrepresented by Dr Herbert Miles, i would look at it myself, maybe the risks don't apply to my age group or physical condition. The research needs to be peer reviewed, and maybe a study has been done into the effectiveness of the medicine and low risk for liver health. I would get a second opinion from an in-person medical professional before continuing. Their response and my individual research would grealty sway my final decision. I would take the medication if it was safe.
