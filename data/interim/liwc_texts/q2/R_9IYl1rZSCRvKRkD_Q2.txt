I would be taken back and curious and confused. I would research the supposed data and evidence that dr miles presented and have a look at it myself, following this I would message the clinician and double check if any of the data was actually accurate. if I was still confused I would seek another opinion from another doctor, and depending on that I would either choose to take the drug or not with more research and information.
