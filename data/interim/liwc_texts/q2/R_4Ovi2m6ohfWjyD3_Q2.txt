Hmmmmmm... On one side my doctor has said that Medex it a safe drug which works well to combat recurring headaches. On the other hand, Dr Miles has provided clear evidence of serious risk to my liver health. I really should give those medical articles a read right away. I should ask my parents what they think about the whole situation and ask for their input. First I would gather information about the pros and cons surrounding the use of the drug by reading the articles and consulting other people before I choose to take the drug.
