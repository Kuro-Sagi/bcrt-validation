Oh no — seriously? I feel my stomach drop a little as I watch Dr Miles’ video. It’s not just someone ranting — he’s calm, he’s got credentials, and he’s citing journal articles. That part grabs me. My first instinct is confusion and a bit of anxiety. My doctor told me Medex was safe and had minimal side effects. I was ready to start it tonight… and now I’m wondering if I’ve missed something big.

I screenshot the video and send it to my GP with a short message: “Hey, I saw this online — any thoughts? Just want to double check before I start Medex.” I’m not trying to be disrespectful, but I also want to be sure. At the same time, I message a friend who’s a pharmacist and ask if they’ve heard anything about Medex and liver damage.

To sort out who to trust, I ask myself: What’s the source? My GP has seen my full medical history and prescribed Medex based on that. Dr Miles might be legit, but social media doesn’t give the full context. I try to find the actual journal articles mentioned in the video — if I can read the abstract or conclusion myself, I might see if the claims are overblown or cherry-picked.

Next, I check the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) site or any government health sources to see what they say about Medex’s side effects. If liver issues were a real risk, I’d expect it to be listed somewhere official, not just in a viral video.

In the end, I decide to hold off on taking Medex tonight — not because I’m convinced it’s dangerous, but because I want to clarify things first. I trust my doctor, but I also think it’s responsible to follow up when new information comes up. If my doctor reassures me and the evidence checks out, I’ll start it. But for now, I’d rather be cautious than uncertain.
