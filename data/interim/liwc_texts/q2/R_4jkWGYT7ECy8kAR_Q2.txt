I will be concerned at first, and then question the reliability of the social media GP, because I personally don't trust medical practitioners who are extremely active on social media. 

I will go search for the journal articles myself, and judge whether the data presented is as he says, or overtly distorted by Dr Miles' personal opinions on the drug. I would also see if the article is reliable and peer-reviewed. I might also look at similar articles, and if it is as detrimental as he says, I'll send the articles to my own doctor, and ask for explanations. I'll switch doctors if I believe my own doctor isn't valid after his explanations.

If it isn't the case, and it doesn't pose a serious long-term risk, I'll still probably find another doctor and ask them if they also believe that I can use the drug. If this doctor also approves, I will use it.
