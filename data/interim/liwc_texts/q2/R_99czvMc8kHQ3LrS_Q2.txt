My emotional gut reaction would be to trust the doctor saying that there are bad side effects. I would immediately go and research myself on the side effects, looking at all sorts of websites and journal articles (preferably scientific ones with real credibility and websites that end in .org or .edu), and I would also probably consult my mum or a family friend who is a doctor and ask their advice. I would also ask to see if any of my friends have taken this before and if they have noticed any side effects.
