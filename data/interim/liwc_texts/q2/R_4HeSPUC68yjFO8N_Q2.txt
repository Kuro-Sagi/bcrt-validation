When I watched Dr. Herbert Miles' video, I felt a rush of anxiety. I was relying on Medex to relieve my recurrent headaches based on my doctor's recommendation, but now I'm confronted with this serious long - term risk claim.
I'd like to message my doctor, asking for clarification. I'd say, "Doctor, I just saw a video from Dr. Herbert Miles warning about the severe long - term liver risks of Medex. Is this true? You told me the side effects were mild."
To determine which information is trustworthy, I'd look into the medical journal articles that Dr. Miles showed. I'd check if they are from reputable journals and if the research methodology is sound. I'd also consider the doctor's professional standing and the credibility of his sources.
Before making a choice, I'd contact my doctor's office to schedule a follow - up appointment. I'd ask for their opinion on these new concerns and if there are alternative medications.
After careful consideration, I'd decide not to start taking Medex for now. The potential liver risk is too concerning, and until I can get a more comprehensive and reassuring explanation from my doctor, it's not worth the risk.
