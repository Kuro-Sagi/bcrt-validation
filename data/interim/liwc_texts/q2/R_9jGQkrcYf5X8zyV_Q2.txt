At first, I thought Medex was a good medicine for my headaches. Since i have watched the video by Dr Herbet Miles I am unsure. Both individuals are doctors with adequate education, and Dr Miles has medical journals supporting his claims. I don't know where I should take the medicine or look for alternatives for my headaches.
