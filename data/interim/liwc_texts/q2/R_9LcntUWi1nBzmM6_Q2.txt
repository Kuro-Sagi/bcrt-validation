A. I would not be overly worried as I am cautious when regarding new information that I am introduced to. I would momentarily question the doctor on the internet and want to check their qualifications.
B. I would ask my clinician about it after messaging my mum linking the video and asking for her take. If she agreed I should maybe question it I would then ask the decision.
C. Look for qualifications on the page, check for cited sources and comments for any verified doctors replying to the post.
I would continue to take the medication in the mean time, wait for the response of my mum, then email my doctor if my mum is worried about it and if I remained nervous about it too.
