1. I would be a little concerned, but I personally trust my personal doctor over an online presence.

2. I would definitely contact my clinician first and ask about the veracity of Dr Miles' claims, as well as the clinical trials for Medex mentioned earlier. I would not contact my family or friends unless they were educated in a school of science and graduated recently. If they do, I would forward the articles mentioned in Dr Miles' video and ask them for their interpretation, and take their advice onto board.

3. I would decide which information is trustworthy depending on the number of scientifically educated opinions I receive for each side. Personally I would still have an inclination to trust my own doctor over Dr Miles.

4. If there is a genuine real concern for Medex causing liver damage, I think I would maybe even go to another doctor at another clinic and ask for their opinion, and whether there are any substitutes.

Depending on the information I am presented, I would choose to take Medex or ask for a substitute. However, I am more likely to take Medex just because I trust my personal doctor more than an online presence.
