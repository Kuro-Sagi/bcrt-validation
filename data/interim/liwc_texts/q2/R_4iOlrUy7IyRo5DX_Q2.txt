I would immediately be confused. Why would something being sold over the counter have serious ling term health detriments? I'd try my best to find the articles shown by Dr Miles, and conduct my own research. Usually I wouldn't go this far, but this could affect my health so I want to be sure of what Im putting in my body. I think maybe I would start taking the medication, finishing the prescription and then, if they work, return to the doctor to get another script. It would be here were I inquire about Dr Miles and his position, hoping to get some clarity and see if his claims can be debunked. I should not have any reason to doubt the doctor, he is licensed and works at a reputable company. Dr Miles however, I am not sure about the validity of his credentials. I would take the doctor's advice, which most likely would be to continue taking the medication.
