The moment I saw Dr Miles’s video, my stomach dropped. I felt confused and honestly, a bit scared. My doctor had just told me that Medex was safe and effective, with only mild side effects — now someone online is saying it could damage my liver long-term? That’s a huge claim, and I don’t want to risk my health.

I would probably send the video to my doctor with a message like: “Hi, I just saw this — should I be worried?” I might also bring it up in a family group chat to see if anyone else has heard of these risks. But I also know social media can blow things out of proportion, and not everything online is accurate.

To decide what’s trustworthy, I’d look up the actual journal articles shown in the video, if possible, and see what the studies really say. I’d also check if any official health organizations like the TGA or FDA have issued warnings about Medex. Dr Miles might be right — but he could also be selectively presenting information for views.

Before I make a final decision, I’ll call my GP and ask about the risks and whether anything’s changed since the clinical trials. I’ll also ask if there’s an alternative to Medex that’s just as effective but with less controversy.

Final decision: I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now until I speak directly with my doctor. I want to be sure I’m not putting my liver at risk unnecessarily, but I also don’t want to jump to conclusions based on social media panic. My health is too important.
