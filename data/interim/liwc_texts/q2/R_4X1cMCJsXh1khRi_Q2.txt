i'll try to find tertiary opinions on that drug and if i know anyone that has used that drug before. i will also try to do more research by myself. as far as i know, there are ,ost likely substitute for most drugs when it comes to common symptoms, like headahce. i will deduce that i may not need to eat strictly just this medicine. so i might look for an alternative.
