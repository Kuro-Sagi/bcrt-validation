Immediately I would be shocked, because the patient-doctor relationship is built on trust, and if the doctor is not informing me of all the risks, then it undermines the belief in the healthcare system. 

I would then read into these medical journals that have been cited, investigating if what Dr Miles has said is true or if it is being exaggerated. I would also ask some known people who practice medicine of their opinion before making my own opinion of if the risks are valid. If I make the conclusion they are, then I would make another appointment with my doctor to inform them of my concerns. It is possible that the doctor did not know of the long-term risks of the medicine before prescribing it.
