Not that much surprised since every drugs have side effects. I would say if u have certain disease that coould interact with the drug don't take the medcine and I will ask my clinician about does my other diseases could interact with this drug? To my family I would say use more basic paracetamol or neurofen other than this new drug for a period of time. I would check the medication box and I will check the ingredients in it so that I'm not allergic or have drugs reactions with it. Then I will check side effects profile and efficacy profile. Online clinician is not repuatable enough for me. I will take the medication and I will be the one to decide whether it has very extreme side effects or not because in the end it depends on individual health conditions.
