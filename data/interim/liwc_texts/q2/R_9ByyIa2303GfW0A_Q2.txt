At first, I would feel slightly conflicted as both were doctors. I would think that maybe Dr Herbert Miles is just saying these things about Medex for benefits of popularity, but also on the other hand, the Doctor that handed me the drug could have also made a mistake as it is not impossible. I would message the clinician to double check and do some research myself online. I would also ask my family and friends if they have tried the drug and seen any side effects. I would decide if it is trustworthy based on the collective information.
