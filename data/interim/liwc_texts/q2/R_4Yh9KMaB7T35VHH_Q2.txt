okay i'd be a little worried but my doctor knows my medical condition more than someone else. the majority doens't represent me always. i'd look it up online to see what the misrepresentation comments are talking about, if there are any forums of people talking about it and how it positively affected him, and dr miles' reliability. i know a lot of internet doctors arent reliable even if they went to med school.

i see if i can book a short appointment w the doctor to talk about it. if not, i'll ask the pharmacist. ultimately i will take the meds
