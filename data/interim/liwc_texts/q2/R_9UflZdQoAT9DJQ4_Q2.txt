Once, after seeing Dr Mike's video, I would gain some scepticism relating to the drug, then check online with official websites regarding the drug, since it's important to be aware that online misinformation is extremely common. I would ask my GP at my next appointment to confirm the side effects and my worries, and then confirm any scepticism I have regarding Medex. I would also ask any family or friends who have personally had experiences using the drug and ask for their opinion, how they reacted and how they are going now in terms of liver condition.
