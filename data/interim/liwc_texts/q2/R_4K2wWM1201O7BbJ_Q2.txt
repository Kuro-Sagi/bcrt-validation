Here’s my unfiltered thought process after watching the video:

​​A. Immediate Emotional/Gut Reaction:​​
"Ugh, why now? Just when I felt relieved about finally having a solution for these headaches... This video instantly spikes my anxiety. The images of medical journals look legit, and he’s a real doctor with a big following—but is he exaggerating for clicks? I feel torn: my own doctor seemed so confident, yet this warning about ‘serious long-term liver risks’ is terrifying. Am I choosing between crippling headaches or ruining my liver? Why didn’t my doctor mention this? Now I’m second-guessing everything."

​​B. What I’d Say to Clinician/Family:​​

​​To my doctor:​​ "Hi Dr. [Name], I saw a viral video by a GP claiming Medex has significant liver risks not widely disclosed. Can we discuss this? Are the studies he cites credible?"
​​To a trusted friend/family:​​ "Freaking out a bit—just got prescribed Medex, but this popular online doctor says it’s dangerous. What would you do? Feels like medical whiplash..."
​​C. Deciding What’s Trustworthy:​​

​​Source Motive & Credibility:​​
Is Dr. Miles genuinely warning people or chasing viral engagement? Check his past content—does he often make alarmist claims?
GP ≠ specialist: Is he a hepatologist or just citing studies he might misinterpret?
​​Evidence vs. Emotion:​​
He showed ‘journal images’—but were they screenshots of full studies or cherry-picked excerpts? Did he share journal names/dates so I can verify?
Clinical trials backing my doctor involved thousands; his "evidence" might be tiny outlier studies.
​​Consensus Check:​​
Do major health bodies (FDA, NHS) flag this risk? If it’s truly widespread, why isn’t it on Medex’s label?
​​Comments Aren’t Data:​​
Mixed comments mean nothing—crowds aren’t peer review.
​​D. Checks/Actions Before Deciding:​​

​​Cross-Check Official Sources:​​
Pull Medex’s FDA/EMA safety leaflet → scan for liver warnings.
Search PubMed for recent meta-analyses on Medex + liver risk (not single studies).
​​Contextualize the Risk:​​
How "serious" is serious? 1 in 100,000? Or 1 in 10? Are high doses/long-term use required?
Could risks apply to me? (e.g., I don’t drink alcohol, which often compounds liver strain.)
​​Consult My Doctor (Non-Negotiable):​​
Forward the video/link and ask: "Can you address this specifically?"
​​Short-Term Safeguard:​​
If headaches are unbearable tonight, take half the dose while I investigate—avoid full commitment.
​​Final Decision & Why:​​
​​I’LL START TAKING MEDEX—BUT MONITOR CLOSELY & VERIFY WITH MY DOCTOR.​​

​​Why:​​

​​Trust Hierarchy:​​ My doctor’s direct clinical judgment + large-scale trial data outweigh a GP’s social media post—unless evidence emerges that contradicts this.
​​Benefit/Risk Calculus:​​ My headaches significantly impact my life; the proven benefit outweighs a theoretical long-term risk. OTC status implies safety for most users.
​​Mitigation Plan:​​
Immediately email my doctor with the video and request follow-up.
Start at the lowest effective dose.
Get baseline liver blood tests now and repeat in 3 months.
Track symptoms: if I notice fatigue/nausea/jaundice, I’ll stop immediately.
