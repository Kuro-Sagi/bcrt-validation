Data can misinterpreted and I know nothing about Dr Miles. People online can sometimes have ulterior motives and I would definitely trust my GP more than I trust Dr Miles. Next time I go in I'd probably still ask my GP about the medicine but would keep taking it. If I was seriously ill I'd definitely take it but maybe if it was less severe I'd hold off at least till I did my own research.
