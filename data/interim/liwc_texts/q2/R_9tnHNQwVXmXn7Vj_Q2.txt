When I hear that Medex may have had a negative effect, I am surprised by that. I feel a struggle about which advice I should listen to. Should I listen to my personal doctor or listen to Dr. Herbert Miles, who is also a professional doctor? However, Dr. Herbert Miles used some medical journal articles supporting his claim. Therefore, I am maybe 50% on believing what he mentioned. I think my final decision may be not to choose to use Medex. I may ask more professional people to find out if Medex had a negative effect.
