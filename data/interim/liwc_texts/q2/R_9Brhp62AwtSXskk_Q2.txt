I would be somewhat skeptical. I would be slightly worried about the long-term side effects, but the good thing is that I have not tried it for more than a day. So, if there were any side effects, it probably would not impact me as much. I would probably alert my friends and family members that also use the drug, and I would immediately consult my doctor about it. I wouldn't believe everything on social media, even if it were a doctor with a large following. And I'd also consider that the journals that the Dr. Herbert Miles showed - are only the ones that show negative effects of the drugs. Results can vary from person to person. I would probably rely on credible online sources to check if my medication is safe to consume in the long run. And just to be sure, I would ask for a second opinion from a different doctor.
