A. My gut feeling would be worry and frustration. Watching the video would have left me unsettled, almost with a sinking feeling and did my doctor miss something important about Medex? I’d also feel annoyed, wondering why my doctor didn’t bring up any serious risks if they exist.

B. I would probably message my doctor straight away if its true and I might also bring it up in the family group chat to see if anyone else has heard of this.

C. I know videos like this can go viral even if the claims aren’t fully accurate. 
D. I wouldn’t take the medication right away. The headaches aren’t urgent, and I’d rather be 100% sure before starting something that might have risks.

My decision: I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now and speak to my doctor tomorrow. I want to make the safest choice with the best information before I start the medication.
