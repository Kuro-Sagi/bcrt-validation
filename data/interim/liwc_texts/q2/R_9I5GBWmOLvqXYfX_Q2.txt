I would do my own research into the drug regarding Dr Miles' claims, because the claims are very serious and as a practising GP citing medical journals in his claim, he has credibility. I would look into Dr Miles himself - where he practises, what other content he has posted online and his personal credibility. I would research these medical journals he cites and what they say, but also research other articles that support Medex as a safe drug. It is also prudent to look into what other doctors say and conclude about the drug. If I depend on the information stated without doing further research, I would not take the drug just to be on the safe side and look for alternative, more reliable drugs.
