A. Skepticism on both ends. Whilst I don't trust online doctors, if they are citing research papers that I can look at I would definitely feel uneasy about taking the drugs. 
B. If the risks aren't that big and I am only taking it for a short amount of time, I would consider taking it until our next meeting before messaging anyone. If convenient I would inquire about the clinicians opinion on the research articles that claim negative effects of the drugs. 
C. By looking at the research and talking to different professions. 
D. I would probably do some research online, look at a few articles and a few more videos. If there is an online consensus the drug is bad I would talk to my doctor immediately. If there are mixed messages I would still consider talking to my doctor but with not as much haste. 

D is my final decision.
