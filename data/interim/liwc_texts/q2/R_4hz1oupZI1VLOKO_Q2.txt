While my immediate emotional reaction would be to distrust the medication, my rational side would come out because I do not tend to trust social media. I would first save the journal articles for later to research. I would then go down the research rabbit hole to truly analyse and understand the data myself. Then I would consult my doctor with the information I've found and ask for more. I would message, "Hey Dr. [name], I've been reading [medical article] and it says there are concerns with the side effects of Medex? I was wondering if there was more information you could provide me on the basis of these effects."
In the end, I would most likely trust my doctor, as they have my personal medical history and understand me as an individual better than the study. I would ultimately leave it up to the doctor to decide whether the medication would best suit me.
