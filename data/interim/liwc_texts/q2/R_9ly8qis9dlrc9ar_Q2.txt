At first my reaction was either dr miles was either doing this for clout, or possibly new research had surfaced, shedding light on the dangers of this drug. In both cases, Iâ€™d still seek out a second opinion, and present what I have been told and seen (the video). I would also consider doing some of my own research, notably the documents dr miles cited in his video testing the validity, checking if it was peer reviewed, when the study was published, etc.
