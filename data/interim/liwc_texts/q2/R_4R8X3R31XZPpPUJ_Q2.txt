I felt somewhat suspicious, but I will try and do my own research as well as ask close friends and family of what they think, and ill take in the majority vote as which side it is leaning to. If my close friends and family say that it is fine and they've tried it before I would likely just use it anyway, if they say the opposite I would not, as simple as that.
