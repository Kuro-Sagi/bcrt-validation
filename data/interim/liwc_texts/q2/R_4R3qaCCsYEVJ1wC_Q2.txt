A. Immediate gut reaction would be confusion, maybe slightly scared that that information could be correct, and that i hadn't heard anything at all about liver effects from my doctor. 
B. Probably nothing - might potentially mention it to my doctor at my next appointment, but wouldn't actively try and contact them outside of that. 
C. I would definitely do some digging into that article about liver damage, and check if its from a trustworthy journal (peer reviewed etc) and maybe look into what the actual stats were in terms of people who had liver complications. 

Honeslty, I would probably end up ignoring the video - for 2 main reasons: 
1. even if it is correct and there is a chance of liver complications, if my doctor hasn't discussed it i'm sure that chance is incredibly small and not something worth worrying about especially if the medicine is proving effective in treating the headaches. 
2. I have no idea what the qualifications of some random dr online are, and would have to do some more research to look into the validity of the journal article. 

Even if initially i might be slightly scared that i could experience liver complications, i think looking into the stats would reassure me either that this wasn't the case or that it was a very small possibility, so in either case i would probably just proceed with my drs recommended course of treatment.
