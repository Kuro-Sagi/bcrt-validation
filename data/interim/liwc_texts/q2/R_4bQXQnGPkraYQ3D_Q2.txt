While watching the video, I would feel some tension and anxiety over the reliability of Medex but would keep some skepticism as not everything on the internet is portrayed accurately. The further into the video I get however, the more nervous I would get as he supports his claims by showing images of medical journal articles, suggesting that the information he is presenting is backed up by other professionals and research conducted on the dangers of Medex. I would first message my family and friends telling them about the risks I saw about the drug and see if they had any additional input and I would then message my clinician asking about the risks and if they knew about it before prescribing it to me, and whether they believe Dr Miles is a trustworthy source of information. I would also try and get a second opinion from another GP and see whether they prescribe Medex as well, and if they don't, I would ask them if they knew about the side effects of Medex to be certain if my previous GP was prescribing me with a dangerous drug.
