I would immediately be concerned about the conflicting opinions. I don’t think listening to the comments is helpful, so I probably wouldn’t read too far into them or let them dictate what I do. I would probably go to a pharmacy and let them know about my concerns and use that as a second opinion. If the pharmacist or doctor there agreed with my doctor, I would probably go on to ask friends and family if they had any personal experiences with the drug. If they had, I would trust their opinions and get an idea of what the general consensus is. I think I would ultimately approach my doctor as a final step and express my concerns to them before deciding what to do. I would want my doctor to reassure me about the validity of Dr Miles’ claims and the suitability of the articles he references. If there wasn’t conflicting opinions between the pharmacist, my friends and family and the doctor, I think I would start taking Medex.
