 I was feeling okay about taking Medex after speaking with my doctor, but now I feel uneasy, even anxious. If there’s a serious long-term risk to my liver, why didn’t my doctor mention it? Is this something new, or did they downplay it?

I’d probably send the video to my doctor with a short message like, “Hi, I came across this and wanted to check if there’s any truth to it should I be concerned?” I’d also ask a friend who’s studying medicine what they think, just to get another perspective.

To figure out what’s trustworthy, I’d try to find the journal articles Dr Miles shows in his video and look up the actual studies  not just screenshots or headlines. I’d also check whether other reputable health organisations, like the TGA or WHO, have issued warnings about Medex. If this were a real concern, I feel like there would be more mainstream coverage or official guidance, not just a social media post.

Before starting Medex, I’d wait for a reply from my doctor. If they explain that Dr Miles’ claims are based on outdated or misinterpreted data, and they still recommend the medication, I’d probably go ahead  but maybe ask about alternatives too. For now, I decide to hold off taking Medex until I’ve had a proper conversation with my doctor, just to feel confident I’m making the safest choice.
