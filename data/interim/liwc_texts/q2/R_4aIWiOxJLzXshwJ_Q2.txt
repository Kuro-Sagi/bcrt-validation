My immediate gut reaction would be to trust my own doctor, as they know my medical history the best (including reactions/side affects of medications with other meds I am on). I also generally do not trust social media medical advice, as advice varies on individual circumstances - another reason for choosing to take Medex. If I was concerned, I would do my own research on google, and perhaps go to the pharmacy or contact my doctor the next day with any questions. I may also check online to see if Dr Miles has reliable credentials, due to the mixed responses in his comments. I would overall trial Medex for a period of time, therefore trusting my doctor, and regularly test for liver function if I was highly concerned.
