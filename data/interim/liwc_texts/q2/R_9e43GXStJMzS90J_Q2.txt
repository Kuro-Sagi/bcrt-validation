When I first saw Dr Miles’ video, I felt confused and a bit anxious. I trust my doctor, but the video was persuasive — especially the part where he showed journal article screenshots. It made me question whether I had been fully informed about Medex. I wouldn’t want to risk long-term liver damage just to treat my headaches.

Before jumping to conclusions, I’d message my doctor and say, “Hey, I came across a video claiming Medex can cause long-term liver issues — could we chat about it? Just want to make sure I’m making the right call.” I’d also look up the full articles Dr Miles referenced, not just the snippets shown in the video, to see if the data was taken out of context.

To figure out what’s trustworthy, I’d compare what peer-reviewed research says with guidance from official sources like the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) or health.gov.au. I’d also check whether Dr Miles has any conflicts of interest or a history of sensationalising health content online. If his claims hold up under scrutiny, I’d want to know — but if not, I won’t let fear-driven social media posts override medical advice from a qualified clinician who knows my history.

Ultimately, I’d delay taking Medex until I can speak with my doctor and verify the claims. It’s not worth the risk of blindly starting or stopping a drug based on a viral post, especially when the medical consensus might say otherwise.
