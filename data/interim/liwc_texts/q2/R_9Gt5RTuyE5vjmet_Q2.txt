My immediate reaction is to laugh at this guy online as I do doubt it compared to a doctor I see in person and I feel like they would warn me instead or people selling me the drug would warn me. I would probably not mention it to friends or family unless I find it really funny and want to show people listening to an online doctor over person to person interactions. I would probably decide depending on my doctor who I have probably seen many times over my life. The only check or action I would do is probably a google search and reading the box the medication is in. I would probably still take the medication in the end.
