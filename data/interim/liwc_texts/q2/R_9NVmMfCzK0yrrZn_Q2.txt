I will send this video and the references to the doctor to inquire about the specific situation. If I am only taking the medication for a short period or in an emergency, it does not pose a long-term risk. I will simply take it directly. If I need to take the medication for a long time, I will first propose whether it can be changed to another drug. If there are drugs with lower risks available, I will directly switch to them and disregard the truth. If it is not possible to change the medication, I will consult a specialist doctor instead of believing the general practitioner's professional knowledge in this area. Then, I will ask them to provide me with the latest professional articles for reference. Because the videos and articles posted by general practitioners on the internet might be outdated theories that have been disproven. Finally, if all the evidence indicates that the medication is harmful and I must take it for a long time, I will discuss alternative solutions with a better doctor.
