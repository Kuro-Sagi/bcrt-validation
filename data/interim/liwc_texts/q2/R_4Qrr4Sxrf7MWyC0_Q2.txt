The moment I watch the video, my immediate gut reaction is anxiety and doubt. I feel slightly panicked because I was just prescribed Medex, and now there’s this doctor claiming it could seriously harm my liver. My first instinct is to think, “Wait, why didn’t my doctor mention this? Did they miss something?” but then I remind myself not to jump to conclusions based on a single social media post.

If I were to say something to anyone right away, I might message my clinician or pharmacist, asking, “Hey, I just saw a video about Medex causing liver damage long-term — is this something I should be worried about?” I might also talk to a family member, mostly to get some reassurance, but I’d prefer to consult medical professionals first.

To decide what’s trustworthy, I’d think about the sources. Dr Miles is a practising GP, but social media can often exaggerate things for views. I’d want to see whether his claims are supported by peer-reviewed studies, whether the journal articles he showed are credible, and whether health authorities like the TGA, FDA, or WHO have issued warnings.

Before making a choice, I’d check reliable medical websites, read independent reviews, and maybe book a quick follow-up call with my doctor to directly discuss the risk versus benefit for me personally.

My final decision: I’d hold off on taking Medex until I speak with my doctor again. The potential risk might be exaggerated, but I’d rather be sure, especially if there are alternative treatments for headaches with no controversy.
