My immediate reaction would be worry and panic, maybe relief that I haven't yet taken the drug.
I would consider the perspectives of other who say the data is misrepresented, as this is quite common in social media. I would fact check what they say by looking through the journal articles myself. If in doubt, I would consult my clinician and seek their advice. 
Given that social media can be unreliable and that even medical professionals can make false claims, I'm inclined to believe my doctor. 
While considering the severity of my headaches, I would refrain from taking the medication until I am sure of what information is trustworthy.
Considering all the above, I'd likely continue taking the medication.
