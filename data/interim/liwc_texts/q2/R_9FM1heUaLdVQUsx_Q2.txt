my immediate reaction would be like oh no thats not good but also its social media and long term risk like lots of things have long term risks but ill be fine. i would probably bring it up to my friends/ family if i was talking to them but wouldnt go out my way to message them and just be like oh this is kinda funny and hear their opinion. maybe though after talking to my friends/ family i would do my own research to see what is being said about it. i would trust my doctor rather than the one on social media because lots of that information isnt accurate and stretched from the truth. however, i would be slightly concerned and if my own research said it was bad i would stop taking it and ask my doctor. maybe. i dont think i would think about it too much to be honest.
