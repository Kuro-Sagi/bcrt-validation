I would be sceptical to take that medicine if a certified doctor on a video is stating that the drug can give you long term liver affects. I would show try doctor the video and ask if this is dangerous or not. It depends on what my doctor says about the drug but nevertheless, I would still be skeptical about taking that specific medicine. I would also ask if there was another drug that I could take.
