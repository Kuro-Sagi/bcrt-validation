Oh no, this is confusing. My immediate gut reaction is anxiety and doubt — I trusted my doctor but now this video makes me worry about liver damage. I feel a bit overwhelmed because both seem credible: my doctor is a professional and so is Dr Miles.

I would probably send a quick message to a friend who knows more about health or medicine, just to see what they think. Then I might message my doctor: “Hi, I just saw a video warning about liver risks from Medex — is this something I should worry about?”

To decide what’s trustworthy, I would look at when the research Dr Miles shows was published — is it recent? Does it match what my doctor said about clinical trials? I’d also check official health websites like the Australian TGA or WHO for reliable information.

Before deciding, I would wait and maybe schedule a call with my doctor. My final decision: delay starting Medex until I get clarification directly from my doctor, because their advice is personal and they know my medical history.
