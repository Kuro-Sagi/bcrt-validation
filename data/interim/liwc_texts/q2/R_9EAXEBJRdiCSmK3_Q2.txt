When I first saw Dr. Miles’ video, my immediate reaction was surprise and worry: “Wait, is this true? Could this medicine really harm my liver?”
I felt a wave of doubt, because my doctor seemed so confident earlier today that Medex was safe and effective.

My first instinct is to send a message to my doctor: “I just saw a video saying Medex could harm the liver—should I be worried?” I’d probably also share it with a close friend and ask, “Have you heard anything like this before?”

Before making any decisions, I would try to figure out whether this information is reliable. Social media videos can be misleading, so I would look up the journal articles that Dr. Miles showed in the video to see if they were recent, well-respected studies or taken out of context. I might also check trusted medical websites or call a pharmacy for professional advice.

In the end, I would still choose to trust my doctor and start taking Medex, but I would keep monitoring and ask more questions at my next appointment. My decision is based on the fact that my doctor knows my personal health history, while a short social media video doesn’t tell the full scientific story.
