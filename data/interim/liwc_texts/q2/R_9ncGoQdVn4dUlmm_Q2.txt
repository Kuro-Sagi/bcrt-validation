Well that is pretty unsettling, I'm not sure who to trust. This doctor online is making a pretty good case with those articles he found and what if it messes up my liver long-term. I need to be cautious. Social media however tends to exaggerate things and strive on fear and drama. I'd probably contact my GP to see whether he has seen this video and if I should be concerned. I trust my doctor but I also want to show that I'm taking initiative. To figure out what's trustworthy, its best to check the image articles in the video and see if they are true and said what they said. Again social media users use dramatic headlines without proper context. If Dr Miles is right, there should be more widespread concern, not just a viral video. I might also talk to a pharmacist. They're often super knowledgeable about drug effects and might offer me useful insight. In the end, I'd hold off on taking Medex for a while till a get proper confirmation. I need proper reassurance and if that can't be acquired then I'll find another solution or prescription.
