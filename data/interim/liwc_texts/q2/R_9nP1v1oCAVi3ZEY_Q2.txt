My immediate reaction is to want more information. I would try and find the journal articles to read myself, and start doing some further research into Medex and see if there are many competing opinions. I'd also watch a few other videos from Dr Miles, and see if his other videos seem reasonable and balanced, or if they seem 'click-baity' and share views that frequently oppose the general opinion from medical journals and other clinicians.
Once I read through the articles he quoted, if I felt the journal was clearly aligned with Dr Miles' interpretation, I would book another appointment with my doctor to discuss. However, it would depend on the Dr that originally prescribed me the drug. For example, I've been seeing my current GP for 10 years and I really trust her as a doctor, and I think her knowledge of me and my health history would mean I easily trust her over another Dr I've never met. But if for some reason I had to see another GP or specialist I didn't know very well, I would be way more likely to take the video from Dr Miles seriously. I would also try and verify his qualifications, and try to get an idea of his reputation in the medical field. 
In this situation, I would do my own research, but only if there was heaps of well documented research that supported Dr Miles, I would trust my own doctor oveer him.
