I would be lost without knowing what to do. I might send the video to my friends, ask them whether I should trust my doctor or the GP. additionally, I might text the clinic about the information I saw and ask for their opinion. furthermore, I might started googling Medex online and search for its negative effects in order to make my decision on whether to continue consuming. after getting results from google, as well as suggestions from family and friends, I would make my final decision based on them.
