i don’t trust online doctors right off the bat i’d like take it into consideration but not much beyond that, maybe bc ion care abt the future maybe bc that’s one man’s opinion. If it’s available over the counter it’s probably gonna be fine these things are well tested. I might bring it up to my doctor and see what he thinks and all and if ik someone taking the same medication i’d also question them about it. But that’s all it wouldn’t make me spiral automatically
