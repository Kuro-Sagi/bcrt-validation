My immediate reaction is that of more suspicion to Medex than previously held, however I would always fact-check by consulting a knowledgeable third party to examine the source or do so myself. To my clinician, I would ask whether this doctor was appropriately representing the data, and amongst those I care about I may be inclined to express hesitancy, but as aforementioned that has to be analysed. Using sources, checking if studies available support each other and replicate, also examining the involvement of special interests in current evaluations of the product. My final decision is to accept Medex, but constantly revise my belief and pull the plug if there's sufficient evidence of liver damage.
