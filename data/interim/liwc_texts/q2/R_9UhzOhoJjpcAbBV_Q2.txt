a. "I should get off this." "How much do I need this medication, and how effective is it in stopping my recurring headaches?" "Is there another alternative I can take?"  

b. I'd ask friends and family for advice; this situation would most likely make me anxious and concerned for my health. I'd also go back to my GP and ask if there is another alternative I can take.

c. If it is backed by empirical articles and multiple articles, then yes, it is accurate. 
 
d. I'd also do my own research into the medication from client reviews on youtube, Reddit, etc. 

I would probably get off my medication out of health anxiety fears.
