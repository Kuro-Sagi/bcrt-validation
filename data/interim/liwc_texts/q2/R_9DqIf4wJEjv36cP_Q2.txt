I would initially brush it off, as I do not trust all information and sources I get from social media. I have never heard of a Dr herbet miles, and have no verification of his qualifications either which gives me no reason to trust his arguments. However, if i was curious, I would go back to my doctor and show him the social media post, in order to verify whether what Dr Miles says was true or not
