lol guess im screwed. too late I already took the meds so OH WELL. I don't fear death. I know that because Jesus died to save me if I put my trust in him I can have eternal life and go to heaven!!! But its still probably good to be safe. Just in case. I mean i'm only 18 I dont need bad liver health thank you very muchy! i'll go to the doctor and ask her what the deal is. i do trust her shes a close friend and shes really looked after me in the past. she'll be right. also you should'nt believe everything you see on the internet, and those comments did say he was dodgy. we'll go and ask what the big deal is, thats the way to go i'm sure.
