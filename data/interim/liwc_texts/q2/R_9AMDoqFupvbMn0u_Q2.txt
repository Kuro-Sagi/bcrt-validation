At first I will be very concerned for my health and wellbeing. However I'm not bothered to look at journals and articles by myself, so I would stop taking Medex overall and switch to other medicine that have less debate around the side effect of the drug. I will also consult opinions from clinics and pharmacy. But then I know that nearly all medicine affect the liver and the data might not look at users interactions with other drugs which could also affect their liver health. 
It also depends on the duration that I'm required to take the drug, if it's short-termed, I would take it, if it's to treat chronic headache then I might go in for another consultation. 
If I have to decide, I will take the drug, because I trust my doctor. But increase the rate of going for health checkups to see if it's really effecting me personally.
