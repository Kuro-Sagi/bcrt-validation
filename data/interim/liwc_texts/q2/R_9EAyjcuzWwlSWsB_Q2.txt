I would immediately feel as though my health may have been threatened by introducing the Medex drug; however, I would refrain from taking further doses and stay calm until I do more research. I would contact my clinician and tell them about the situation. I would also go to a different doctor and get a second opinion and see which doctor they correlate more with. A large following will not tell me who is more reliable, whereas looking at the credentials of both doctors will. I will also look deeper into the articles by Dr Herbert Miles and look for any credentials on those articles.
