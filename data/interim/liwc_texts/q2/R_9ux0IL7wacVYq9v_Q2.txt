A. I am really conflicted, because there is cases that both can be right or wrong, either and or, as well as it could depend on the person. Does it pose as long term risk for everyone of particular people with underlying conditions. Research on my own aswell

B. Ask supporting friends, family. Research more about it on google, qualified scholars and websites/articles. Asking different GPS, even the health websites.

C. Check supporting articles, personal experiences of different people and see if its underlying conditions that could increase the risk. 

D.  If there are any other ways to help with the headaches, other remedities. And if the recurring headaches could be due to lack of hydration, sleep, food, norusihment etc.


I would probbaly try different remedities, not fully trusting both sides but approaching it cautiously and also seeing if there are other reasons for my headaches, and other ways to fix it asides from medications
