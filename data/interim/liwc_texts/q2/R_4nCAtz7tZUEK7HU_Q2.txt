My immediate reaction would be one of caution, as if this online doctor is as reputable as he claims to be then this warning should hold some merit and be taken into account. If anyone I knew was also taking the medication, I would ask them if they knew anything about the warnings the online doctor provided, and if i thought the warning was severe enough I would also ask my clinician about it. However, taking into account that several comments on the video said the data was being misinterpreted, I would try to do my own research to ascertain what the actual medical studies said about Medex.
