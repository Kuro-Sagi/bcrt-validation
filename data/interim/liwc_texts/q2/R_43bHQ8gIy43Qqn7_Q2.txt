A. Avoid taking the drug for as long as possible until the information I was told is trustworthy
B. I would not say anything cause I would not like to bother them with my personal issue.
C. I will look further into it either through Google or by asking more trusted GPs.
D. Probably another scan for information

My decision will be dependant on how successful the information search about the drug is.
