When I first watch Dr Miles’s video, my immediate reaction is concern — the phrase “serious long-term risk to liver health” feels alarming, especially when paired with medical journal images. At the same time, I feel a degree of scepticism; dramatic online warnings often attract attention, and I know that context can be missing or misrepresented.

My instinct is to message my doctor before making any decision: “I’ve just seen a video from Dr Herbert Miles claiming Medex causes long-term liver damage. Could you please confirm whether this is accurate and if it changes your recommendation?” I might also share the link so they can review the exact content.

To decide whose information is more trustworthy, I would look at the original studies Dr Miles cites — checking whether they are peer-reviewed, how large the sample sizes are, and whether conclusions match his claims. I would also research official health authority statements and consult reputable medical websites for balanced summaries.

Before starting the medication, I would also consider arranging a second opinion, ideally from another GP or pharmacist, to see if there is any consensus.

My final decision would be to delay starting Medex until I receive clarification from my doctor and can confirm whether the safety concerns are legitimate. The potential health risk — if true — outweighs the cost of a short delay, and I prefer to act on confirmed, professional advice rather than potentially misleading online content.
