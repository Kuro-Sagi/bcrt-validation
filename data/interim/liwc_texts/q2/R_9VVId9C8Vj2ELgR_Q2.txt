I would immediately feel a bit concerned about the medication. I would not take it until I had more information and felt I could make a better decision. I wouldn't immediately trust Dr Miles as he is online and I cannot validate his credibility or fully trust the advice he provides. I would get a second opinion from another doctor in person and make my decision based on that. I would share my concerns with close family/friends to see if they had been told to take it/what the advice they were given was. Ultimately, I would do my own research, trust my doctors, and base my decision on that rather than a single doctor online.
