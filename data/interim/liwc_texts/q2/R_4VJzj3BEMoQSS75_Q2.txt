Oh. I should go back to the doctor and show them the video and studies just to confirm whether Medex works well with minimal side effects. I would also do a bit of my own research online maybe on reddit to see what others who have used the medication are saying and if they felt anything different or bad when using it. I'll also research Dr Miles' credentials to see if he's legit because I can't trust GP's online because they're kind of content creators, and they're not always honest. I'll also check out those studies myself to see if he's omitting any information that might be cruical, for example, those people who suffered serious long-term risk to their liver health could have previously had liver troubles or drank too much or things like that. I would ultimately base my decision off several factors, for now, I'd probably avoid taking it until I can talk to the clinician about it.
