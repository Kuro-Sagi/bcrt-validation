This video is pretty concerning. Will Medex harm my health if I take it? Dr Miles seems very popular and is providing evidence, so he seems trustworthy. But there are still people saying he's lying in the comments. Anyways, wouldn't my own doctor know what's better for me specifically? I should ask them what they think. Maybe I should check if any of my friends or family have taken Medex with negative side effects too. I think I'll also do my own research and look at more journal articles to see whether it poses a real risk. I think my final decision would be to take Medex as my personal doctor proposed it for my own condition.
