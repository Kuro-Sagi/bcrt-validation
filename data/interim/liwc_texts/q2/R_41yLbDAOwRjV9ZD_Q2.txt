My immediate gut reaction would be shock and suspicion. I would immediately do more research on the GP's video and check out all his sources to see if they are reputable. I would also search for customer testimonies to see if anyone is experiencing major symptoms or discomfort after using the medicine. I would ask the clinician about the video I saw to see their opinion on it and also consult with friends and family. I would decide which information is trustworthy based on experience and expertise. My final decision would likely be to not take the medicine as there are surely other ones that would not have these side effects which work just as well and I'd rather not risk it.
