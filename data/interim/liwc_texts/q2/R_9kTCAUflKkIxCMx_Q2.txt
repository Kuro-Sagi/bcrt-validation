I would probably not be very concerened given the fact that social media is notoriously filled with misinformation (including many forms of pseudoscience). I'd double check by googling and reading the first couple of scientific websites that come out and unless they all strongly caution about the drug, I'd be unlikely to have any concern as there is no reason to trust some online guru over an actual doctor that I know. I also don't give any weight to social media comments as the vast majority of people on it are uneducated and simply just want a platform to voice themselves (whether correct or not) or just want to boost their engagement through controversial takes.
