The first thing that would come to my mind is "Medex? Could it cause liver damage? This seems to be what a practicing general practitioner with quite a following said. Is it true? But my doctor didn't say this medicine wouldn't cause much damage, did they?" 。 I will leave a message for my friends and family saying "I just read that this medicine called Medex can cause damage to the liver, but my doctor said it doesn't have any obvious harm." I will also leave a message to my doctor saying "I saw a practicing general practitioner say that this medicine Medex can damage the liver. Is this true?" 。 To determine whether this information is true and reliable, one might check whether these journal papers have been published in authoritative journals in the relevant field, such as The Lancet, or to look at the official information regarding this drug. Eventually, I will choose to take the medication after consulting a doctor, because the journal papers mentioned by this blogger have been questioned and their data have been distorted. Moreover, my doctor is aware of my past medical history, but this blogger merely pointed out the potential widespread harm of this drug. In conclusion, if after consulting a doctor and confirming the data, it is confirmed that these data are correct, then Medex can be taken.
