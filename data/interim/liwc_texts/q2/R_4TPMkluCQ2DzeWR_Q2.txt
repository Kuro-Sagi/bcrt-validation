i'd be confused, slightly annoyed at my doctor for not sharing this info, if it is true. annoyed at the online guy if i find that it isn't true. glad that i saw the video.

ask my friends if they;ve any experience with medex. ask clinican about these claims.

read journal articles myself to determine the answer and to see if the data is being misused.

i would read the journal articles myself and do my own research before deciding, however i'd probably lean to trusting my clinican as they are familiar with my health
