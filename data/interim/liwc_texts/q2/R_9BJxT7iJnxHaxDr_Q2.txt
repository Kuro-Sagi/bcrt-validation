Whoa, this is a bit unsettling. I was feeling pretty confident about starting Medex — my doctor seemed sure, and said the side effects were minimal. But now, this video from Dr Miles has thrown me off. Long-term liver risk? That’s a big deal.
I think I’d first message my GP and ask directly, something like “Hi, I just saw a video from a GP warning about Medex and liver damage, is this something I should be worried about?” I trust my doctor more than a social media post, but I still want to double-check.

To figure out what’s trustworthy, I’d look up the actual journal articles shown in the video, if I can. I’d also check what official health bodies like the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) or similar say about Medex.

Final decision? I’ll wait until I hear back from my doctor before starting. It’s not worth risking my liver over uncertainty, even if the evidence might be unclear.
