A. My immediate reaction would be one of dread, but it would quickly turn into suspicion. 

B. I would show my clinician the video and ask them about it. If my friends or family were also on the medication I would send the video and the mentioned studies to them just to let them know, probably by saying "Hey, I'm not sure if you're aware, but this might be something you need to talk to your doctor about." I'd try to word it in a way that wouldn't scare them, but would gently suggest that maybe there's a conversation that needs to be had with their doctor. If none of my family or friends were also on the medication, I probably wouldn't mention it to them. 

C. I would conduct my own research and consult additional sources (especially peer-reviewed articles) to gain a better understanding of the bigger picture and to better educate myself. 

I would probably choose to trust my doctor, but again, more information is required and I would need an explanation from them before making a decision.
