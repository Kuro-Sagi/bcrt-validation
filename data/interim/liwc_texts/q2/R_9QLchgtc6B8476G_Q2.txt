A. scared as i do not want to have serious liver problems and annoyed as i was not informed about these more serious risks of the medication, even if they have a low chance i would prefer to know 
B. ask my clinician what he thinks about the video and studies, ask why he did not tell me these potential risks, ask my family for their input on the risks to gather information on family history to find my susceptibility etc
C. double check the significance of the results of the studies the dr used to back up the claim in his video, double check if the images the dr showed were factual
D. research more into the supposed liver problems and the specific medication, find other research studies, maybe ones that find no risk / mild risks when taking the medication 
Final choice is to continue to take the drug i was prescribed - i can book another appt with my dr to confirm if it is factual as well as discussing my specific susceptibility
