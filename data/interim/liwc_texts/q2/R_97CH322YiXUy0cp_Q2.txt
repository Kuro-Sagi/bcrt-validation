My immediate reaction is a blend of irritation and exasperation towards Friend A for raising concerns about potential food poisoning at the eleventh hour. I feel as though they might be trying to create unnecessary drama or disrupt our plans.

In response to Friend A, I would likely express surprise at their sudden worry and question why they didn't bring this up earlier during our planning discussions.

In determining which information to trust, I would consider the credibility of professional critics' reviews in comparison to random Google reviews mentioning food poisoning incidents. Additionally, I would take into account the overall positive reputation of the restaurant.

Before making a final decision, I would promptly search for more recent reviews or news articles about the restaurant to ascertain if there have been any recent food safety issues.

Ultimately, I would maintain the original booking at the restaurant. I place more weight on the positive professional reviews and my past positive experiences there than on the last-minute concerns raised by Friend A. I would also monitor everyone's well-being during and after the dinner.
