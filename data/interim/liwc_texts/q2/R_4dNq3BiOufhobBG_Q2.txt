My first reaction would probably be to still take the Medex because a lot of online so called "doctors" can just be trying to gain attention. I would also ask my sister about the drug as she is a paramedic and my mum as she is a nurse because they would probably know what to do. The doctor who prescribed me the drug is much more reliable as they are from a doctors office that treats many people. I have no idea who the person online is and they could just be googling all the information or even using AI. I may do a little google too but probably wouldn't need because my sister would know.
My final decision would be to take the medex as it can help to improve my headaches cus headaches suck.
