The video from Dr Miles seems credible, but he only discusses the long-term effects of the drug. It would be a good idea to read some of the academic journals to see if they are helpful in understanding the side effects of Medex as well. Also maybe doing some general research about the drug and seeing what other medical doctors say would be good to see if there is a general consensus. I think I would take Medex only if it was for the short-term, in which I assume I am. If I had chronic headaches, then I would probably want to seek other forms of treatment and not just an over the counter drug.
