A) My immediate reaction would be surprised as the packaging of the product says it has minimal side effects that are mild. However, my gut reaction would tell me to check other sources other than Dr Herbert Miles to ensure other practising GP are on the same page as him.

B) I would warn any friends and family about the information after I check with my clinician and any other clinician to ensure all of them agree with Dr Miles or not. This can help find if Dr Miles is trustworthy or not to ensure safety of consuming Medex. 

C) To decide if the information is trustworthy or not, I will check with other clinicians about Dr Miles claims about Medex and to check online if any sources agree with his claims. Furthermore, I will check online comments to see what they think about his claims.

D) I will see how the situation will go after 2 weeks after Dr Miles claims.
