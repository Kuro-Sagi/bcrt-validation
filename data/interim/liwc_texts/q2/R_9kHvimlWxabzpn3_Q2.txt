I would feel concerned at first but then realise its just a singular post on the internet and it isnt as reliable as it seems. I would not say anything to my clinician, friends or family. I would decide which information is trustworthy by doing my own research online. Ultiamtely, i would probably continue using Medex jsut less often and the next time i buy the product i would as my doctor about the potential for causing liver failure.
