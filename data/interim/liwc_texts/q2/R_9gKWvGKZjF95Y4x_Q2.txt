I would start taking Medex with this review in consideration; doing the right things like drinking a lot of water and following instructions like eating food if necessary with the medicine for example. I would message the clinician, family and friends to gather more opinions before taking the medicine, I would decide to take it as thatâ€™s what was prescribed, unless strong feedback from a range of people against the medicine was received.
