Whoa… that video has definitely shaken me up a bit. My gut reaction is anxiety — I mean, the doctor seemed confident, but now here’s another qualified doctor saying it could damage my liver long-term? That’s a pretty serious risk to just brush off.

The first thing I’d probably do is message my GP and ask if they’ve seen the video or heard of Dr. Miles. I’d want to hear their take directly, especially since they know my medical history. I might even share the video link with them. At the same time, I’d probably send it to a friend who’s into health science — just to get another view.

To figure out what’s actually trustworthy, I’d look up the journals Dr. Miles referred to. Are those peer-reviewed? Recent? Are his claims taken out of context? I’d also check other official sources — like the TGA or medical sites — to see if there are any warnings or updates about Medex.

Until then, I wouldn’t start the medication. I’d rather deal with headaches for a few more days than risk something irreversible. Once I’ve double-checked with my doctor and read up on the research myself, I’ll decide — but for now, better safe than sorry.
