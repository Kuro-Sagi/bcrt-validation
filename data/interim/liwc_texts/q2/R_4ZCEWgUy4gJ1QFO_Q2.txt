I would feel scared initially. I would probably look at Dr Herbert Miles' social media profile to see if he is credible or not. Then i would google to see what other people say or what other studies claim. I would then inspect the medicine bottle and look at the information it provides. If it says that the side effects are for a certain group of people such as pregnant/ underage then i would probably go ahead and start taking it. However, if it still looks really suspicious, i would call the doctor/ clinic and ask if there are any safer and more clinically accepted drug alternatives to Medex.
