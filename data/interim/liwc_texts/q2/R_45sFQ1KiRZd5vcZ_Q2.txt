I would definitely feel conflicted in which to who to trust as my immediate gut reaction was confusion, and I wouldn't know what to act upon. I would say to my friends and family to go see an actual doctor in person to inquire about the medication or video. Furthermore, I would also say to them that you shouldn't trust information online at face value, you either should do your own research about who is portraying this information and also the topic in of it itself, should always visit a local GP to inquire. I would trust my doctor.
