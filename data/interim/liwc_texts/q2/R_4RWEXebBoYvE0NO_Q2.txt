It depends on how well I know my doctor, whether I met them for the first time today or our regular family doctor. If they were a doctor I knew well, I doubt they’d casually prescribe something with serious liver risks without mentioning it. 

Additionally, many sources online are inaccurate. Still, I don’t want to ignore it completely. I’ll probably just message my doctor tomorrow or call them and say, “Hey, I saw a video claiming Medex could have long-term liver effects"

As for now, I’ll still take the Medex. I trust the doctor who knows my history and gave me advice face-to-face. If anything sounds off after we talk, I can always stop or switch meds later. 

But if I didn't know my doctor that well, I might refrain from taking it if I know I wouldn't be seeing them soon but if I was then I would still take it.
