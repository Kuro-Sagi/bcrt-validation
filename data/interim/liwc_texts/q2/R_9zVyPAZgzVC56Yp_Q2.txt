This is a sticky one. although the doctor has prescribed me this drug and informed me that it works well, this online guy has told me it poses long-term risks to liver health and has medical journal articles that support his claim. I would first ask my doctor if these claims are true and then read the articles myself or search on google if these articles have any legitimacy behind them. I would trust my doctor the most and if he says those clinical trials were legitamate and it does work well i would take it. But if the internet and the articles have really strong arguments to persuade me, i would probably not take it.
