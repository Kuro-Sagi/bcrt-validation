I would be shocked, especially if I followed Dr Herbert Miles for a long time. I would immediately look into it, ask my friends / family who work as doctors/ nurses. I would also check many sources and come to a personal conclusion. I will most likely believe Dr Herbert Miles, and maybe show the video to the doctor that prescribed me with it. I would also ensure the doctor that prescribed me is reputable. I would also check if my liver is in good condition, ensuring that if I do take it, the effects would be minimal.
