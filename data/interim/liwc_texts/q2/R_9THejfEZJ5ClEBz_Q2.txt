When I first saw Dr. Miles' video, my heart gave a jolt. I was a little scared. He spoke very convincingly, professionally and with pictures and evidence, which made me lose my confidence in Medex all of a sudden. Although it is an over-the-counter drug, he said it might have a long-term impact on the liver, and this is no joke. My first reaction was: Why didn't the doctor mention this to me? Is it that he doesn't know or doesn't take it seriously?
Final decision:  I won't start taking Medex for now until I confirm that it's really safe for me. It's not that I don't trust doctors, but I think I should have a more comprehensive understanding, especially when there are different voices online. Safety first.
