I would feel a bit concerned and question the reliability of both my doctor and the social media video; though I think I would be more inclined to trust my doctor because social media sources can be unreliable. I would double check with my family and my doctor just to be certain and potentially get a second opinion before choosing whether or not to use the medication; I think that ultimately I would also try to look into the medicine as much as I can myself. I think that ultimately I would just go ahead and take the medicine as prescribed and stop taking it if any side effects were to occur.
