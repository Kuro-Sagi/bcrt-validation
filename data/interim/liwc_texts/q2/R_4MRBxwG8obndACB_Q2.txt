a. i would be a little scared, but realise that the information online can be misconstrued even with data supporting it. 
b. i might bring it up to my clinician if we meet again, but i would not go out of my way to ask, only if what i found was concerning
c. i would fact-check and see other information/data/studies that can prove or contradict what was said by dr miles
d. i would then ask my doctor, if my findings support dr miles video and discuss about it. 

I would ensure I know enough or at least a bit about the drug before consulting/changing it because my doctors decisions should be the best for me.
