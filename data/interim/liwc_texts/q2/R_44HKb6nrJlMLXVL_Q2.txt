A. I definitely would hold on taking the medication, however knowing the reputation online doctor influencers have, I wouldn't be too worried.

B. I would re-check with my clinician for sure. As for family and friends, I wouldn't bother asking, because it would just make the situation more confusing, with more mixed opinions.

C. I would hold on taking the medication, then do more of my own research. Whether it be patient testimonials, or crowd-sourced questions, such as reddit. I would mainly be looking for long-term reviews and see if they've had any effect, possibly coming from my clinician.

D. After doing all of this research by myself, I would most likely still take the medication anyways, considering I personally do not trust online influencers that much, if at all. Considering how mixed the reception of the video was is enough proof for me that it should be fine and these influencers are only spreading misinformation and fear-mongering.
