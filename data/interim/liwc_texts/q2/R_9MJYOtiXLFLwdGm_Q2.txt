Firstly, I would read the articles that Dr Miles cited, as I would have very mixed feelings on the matter - never believe what you see in the media. I would then organise a meeting or message my clinician and link them the video, asking for their advice. I would also consider the liver health of my immediate family, if we have already poor health then I would find an alternative as the risk is too high.
