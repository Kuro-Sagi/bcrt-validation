Initial reaciton is not to take Medex due to the long-term serious health effects. Then I would want to do more research into Medex and see if the information is fake or not. Also I would present these concerns to the doctor who presbribed the medication and get his opinion. The source being from social media, I would trust the doctor who prescribed it to me ultimately and continue taking the meds, but definitely raise concerns with the doctor next time I see him.
