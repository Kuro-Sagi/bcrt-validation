I would look at the medical journal articles myself, and then try to interpret what they are saying. I would feel slightly worried and torn whether i should use Medex, but I would feel that the doctor I saw is more trustworthy than Dr Herbert Miles, as I believe that the fact that a practising doctor is putting so much time and effort on his social media presence is a bit weird and performative, as if perhaps he does not have the correct intentions or he is not that serious about his job. I would do my own research on Medex, and suggest other medications to my doctor. If he still insists that Medex is what I should take, I would take it.
