A. Immediate Emotional/Gut Reaction:
My first reaction is a mix of anxiety and confusion. The doctor prescribed Medex with confidence, but Dr. Miles’ warning about liver risks feels alarming, especially with the images of medical journals. I feel torn—should I trust my doctor or this online GP with a large following? The popularity of the post adds to my unease; if so many people are engaging with it, maybe there’s truth to it? But then again, the mixed comments make me wonder if the data is being exaggerated or taken out of context.
B. Communication with Others:
I’d probably message my clinician first: “Hi, I saw a video online warning about Medex and liver risks. Can you clarify if this is something I should worry about?” I might also ask friends or family if they’ve heard anything similar. Discussing it with them could help me gauge whether this is a known concern or just sensationalism.  
C. Deciding Trustworthiness:  
I’d compare sources:  
- Is Dr. Miles credible beyond his follower count? Does he cite specific studies or just show snippets?  
- What do reputable medical websites (e.g., Mayo Clinic, NHS) say about Medex?  
- Are the journal articles he referenced peer-reviewed, or is he cherry-picking data?  
The fact that comments are divided suggests the issue isn’t black-and-white, so I’d dig deeper.  
D. Checks/Actions Before Deciding:
1. Search for Medex + “liver risk” to see if other experts echo the warning.  
2. Check the prescribing leaflet for side effects—does it mention liver issues?  
3. Look up Dr. Miles’ background. Is he known for alarmist content or balanced takes?  
4. Consider my own health: Do I have liver concerns? Is the benefit of headache relief worth potential risks?  

Final Decision:  
For now, I’ll hold off on taking Medex until I hear back from my clinician. If they confirm the risks are minimal based on broader evidence, I’ll proceed cautiously. If not, I’ll ask for alternatives. Trusting a single viral video feels risky, but so does ignoring it entirely—so I’ll prioritize expert advice over online buzz.
