At first I would feel worried after taking the medication and then seeing it online to have a bad reputaiton. I would not message any friends or family rather I would go to the doctor taht prescribed me medex and asked for his view. I would however trust clinical trials first as medical journal articles may not have done any empirical researhc of their own or obtained data through their own trials. I would do more background research myself and ask people who have taken medex.
