Oh no this is so scary. I know online stuff are normally exaggerated and those people online might be taking things out of its context just to scare us and gain their views but I am not going to risk it. Maybe I should see if there are any other remedies for headaches. I am going to search online for those articles and see them for myself and see if anyone else has said anything about this medicine. I might also go back to the doctor to ask about this medicine, but for now I will not be having it until I have more information on it.
