A. My heart would drop. I would be very panicked and immediately start scouring the internet for more opinions. B. I would first call/ talk to my mum and mention all the information to her, asking for her opinion, my concerns and what I should do next. I would also book an appointment with my GP, ASAP. I'd bring up the research I found, if there's any reason those wouldn't apply to me. I'd also rant to my friends but mostly as an emotional outlet than looking for serious advice. C. I'd stop taking the medication while I waited to decide (if healthy). In this case, the risks outweigh the benefits too much for me to gamble on whether the video is correct or not unless other research proves it incorrect or irrelevant to me in a definite manner. D. I would try to find similar medication with less risks and see if that's effective. I'd also go to another doctor for a second opinion and bring up my hesitations and worries. My final decision would be to stop using the medication regularly for my headaches and reserving it for if it's ever really bad, at least until more research comes out.
