I would immediately feel a sense of fear and uncertainty. Since it was a drug prescribed by my doctor, I would initially have trusted their word and their expertise on it, and seeing another professional argue against the use of Medex would then make me question who to believe. I would probably then ask my friends or family what they think about it, and bring it up to my doctor. I may also visit another doctor to see if they would prescribe the same, or if they also think that Medex isn't reliable. I would also consult the medical journal articles and read about the results and discussions of the articles, to see if the information they present are legit, or if people are misinterpreting the data.
