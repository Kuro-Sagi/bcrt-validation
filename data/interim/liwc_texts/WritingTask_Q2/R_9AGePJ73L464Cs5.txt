i would immediately feel uneasy and anxious. i would probably tell my sister and my friends about it and ask for their thoughts and opinions on whether i would still take the medication or not. my overall gut feeling would tell me to not take it but i think i would ignore it and consume it because at the end of the day it was what my doctor prescribed me after meeting me in person and seeing my symptoms for himself (despite my judgement knowing i probably shouldn’t take the medication). i think after a day or two of consuming the medication as normal, i would be overwhelmed with anxiety of whether or not what i consumed was actually safe, it was probably already lingering in the back of my head for a while as i was taking the medicine. i’d do some more research and would go to another doctor or search up alternative medication i could take instead of that one.
