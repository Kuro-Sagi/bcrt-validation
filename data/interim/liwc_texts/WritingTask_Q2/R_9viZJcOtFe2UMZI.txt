my immediate gut reaction is probably anxiety, because I'm hypochondriac leaning. I'd probably go do some online research from trusted science peer-reviewed articles. if these articles said that medex could, but doesn't necessarily pose serious long term risk, or just anything that isn't 'definitely causes risk', I'd probably feel less anxious. if the science articles said it doesn't, then I wouldn't take any action. if they say could, I'd probably go check back with my doctor. if they say 'will', then I'd freak out, check back with my doctor, and then if they continue to reassure me that it's fine, I'd find another doctor to go to. I'd also probably look into the comments who say that the data is being misrepresented. it's dangerous to fully trust people online- especially this doctor. there's biases in psychology that I learnt about, which makes us trust online actors more than we should, so I definitely wouldn't be quick to fully trust this online doctor.
