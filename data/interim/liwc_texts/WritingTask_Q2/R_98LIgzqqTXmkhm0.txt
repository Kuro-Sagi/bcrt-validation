i would definitely be wary and on guard. initially, I'd continue to read the comment's perspectives and get the packaging of the Medex to check the information for myself with the side effects. Next, I'd skim over Dr Miles other videos and the comments to see if the comments change in agreeing or disagreeing. Then I'd search the web on Medex generally, for both reviews and information. If the long-term side effects do pop up more, i might stop taking Medex. Recurring headaches is a common problem that doesn't require specific medication. Therefore, there should be plenty of alternatives to change to. I'd have a finial discussion with the GP for his own perspective but would request changing medication regardless.
