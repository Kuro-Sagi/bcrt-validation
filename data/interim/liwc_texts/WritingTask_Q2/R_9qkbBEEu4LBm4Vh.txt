When I watched Dr Miles’ video about Medex causing long-term liver damage, I felt worried and unsure who to trust. My doctor had assured me it was safe, so this warning caught me off guard. I’d message my doctor to ask, “I saw a video warning about liver issues with Medex, is that something I should be concerned about?” I wouldn’t stop the medication immediately, but I’d want more information before continuing. To decide who to trust, I’d look up the medical journals Dr Miles referenced and check if they’re peer-reviewed and recent. I’d also consider whether the risks mentioned apply to normal use or extreme cases. Next, I’d book a quick consultation with my doctor to discuss it properly and ask if liver monitoring is needed. Unless I’m shown solid evidence of real risk, I’d keep taking Medex, but I’d do so cautiously and with follow-up checks planned.
