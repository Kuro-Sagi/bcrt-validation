I would feel somewhat confused and question if this drug is ok for me to use given this information I have discovered. I would ask my clinician about this video and Dr Miles to see what he thinks of it to see if I can get any clarification on if the long term effects of the medication have been over exaggerated and only apply to people with certain conditions. I would conduct a brief search of these studies Dr Miles has referred to and get an AI summary to see if they are trustworthy or if the findings from the studies are statistically significant. That would inform my decision whether to trust my clinician or Dr Miles.
