I would consider my familial history of liver health and how well my doctor knows my history. I would also do my own research and look at reviews for the medication, as well as trying to determine the likelihood of any liver issues resulting from the medication. I would ask anyone I know if they've had an experience with the medication and but wouldnt message my clinician. Using all available information, I would make my own informed decision on whether or not to take the medication.
