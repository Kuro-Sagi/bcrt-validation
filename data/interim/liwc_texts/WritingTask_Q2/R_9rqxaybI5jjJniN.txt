Firstly, my first reaction was that more detailed research is needed on the specific effects and side effects of this medication, and I cannot just follow the advice of one doctor. Secondly, I would like to communicate with clinical doctors that when prescribing over-the-counter drugs, detailed descriptions of the drug's effects and side effects should be provided, along with professional medical advice for patients to refer to, rather than simply stating mild side effects. Furthermore, regarding Dr. Miles' warning, a detailed understanding should be conducted on whether the long-term risk of this drug to the liver is within a controllable range. I will ultimately choose to continue taking this medication because Dr. Myers only introduced the side effects of this medication, but he did not provide a targeted medical assessment for my recurrent headache symptoms. Therefore, I chose to consult with my doctor for more information.
