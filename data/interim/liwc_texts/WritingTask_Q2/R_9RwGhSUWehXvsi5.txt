Oh no, why do these things always come up, is my phone listening to everything! I’m actually not one to listen to online docs, so I’m thinking who is this person and why would I listen to them. Let’s do some online research and then book an appointment with my doctor armed with what I have and see what their feedback is. Realistically I’m more likely to follow their advice, especially once challenged further, than someone online.
