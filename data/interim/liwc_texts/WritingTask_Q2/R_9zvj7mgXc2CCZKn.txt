I would be confused then checked for the ingredients they used to make the drug. If I found anything suspicious on the list, I would probably not going to take it as often as it was prescribed. If I found it to be helpful and cause no negative effects to me, then I would tell others not to take what the media says seriously because every human has unique tolerance to such drugs. I would not claim my stance on any sides but be neutral and only consider what is good to my health. One advice I would tell others is, "Take the positive and think about it alone."
