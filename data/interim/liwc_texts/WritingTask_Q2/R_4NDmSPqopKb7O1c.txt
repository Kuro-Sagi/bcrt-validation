Wait… what? Serious liver damage? But my doctor just said it was safe with mild side effects. This video is kind of alarming — and that guy, Dr Miles, is a GP, right? He sounds confident and even pulled up journal articles. Ugh, now I feel really confused and a bit anxious. I don’t want to mess up my health over a headache med. I think I’d message my doctor — maybe something like, “Hey, I saw a video by Dr Miles warning about long-term liver risks with Medex. Just wanted to check if you’ve seen that data?” I’d probably also ask my friend who’s studying medicine what they think. They’re usually good at breaking these things down. To figure out who to trust, I’d look at where the data is coming from. Are those journal articles peer-reviewed and recent? Or cherry-picked old studies? I’d also check if any official health bodies (like the TGA or FDA) have issued warnings or updated advice about Medex. If not, that says something. Final decision? I’d pause taking Medex for now, until I talk to my doctor and check those articles myself. I don’t want to ignore a possible risk — but I also don’t want to overreact to a social media post. Better to ask and be sure.
