I'd feel uneasy watching Dr Miles confidently claim Medex could harm my liver long-term.I don’t want to take something that could silently damage my liver, but I also don’t want to overreact to internet fear-mongering. I’d probably text a close friend something like, “Hey, have you ever heard anything bad about Medex? Just saw this video and now I’m paranoid.” Then I’d think about messaging my doctor: “I came across a video warning about Medex and liver damage. Could we talk about this before I start taking it?” I’d want to hear their take especially if they’ve read the studies Dr Miles references. Dr Miles is a GP, so that lends him credibility. But my own doctor knows my medical history — and also said Medex was backed by trials. I’d want to look up the studies mentioned in the video myself, or find summaries from reputable medical websites or journals. I’d also check if any health agencies (like the NHS or FDA) have issued warnings or guidance about Medex I’d not start taking Medex right away. I’d wait until I could speak with my doctor again and review those studies myself. It’s not that I fully believe Dr Miles, but I now feel a reasonable doubt that deserves clarification. Until I get more clarity, I’d rather err on the side of caution.
