I would be questioning it when the doctor first time mentioned clinical trials -- since I think not being in the medical field that connotation does not seemed guaranteed. When I hear about Dr Herbert's video, I would immediately be concerned and would definitely start researching other common medicine for my sickness. I would think that since this is regarding my health, I would not want to risk anything and just take something more common that has been proven for years instead of choosing which party to trust.
