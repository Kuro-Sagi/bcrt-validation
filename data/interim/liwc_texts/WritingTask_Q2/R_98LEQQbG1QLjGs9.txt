The immediate reaction is concern. If there are reports of Medex being harmful to people and it has been prescribed to me, I'd need to know whatever I could about the drug and its potential effects on the body. I'd let my clinician know about the social media post but I wouldn't immediately agree or disagree with its views. I would only message friends and family after I'm sure that Medex is harmful, if not then there's no reason to let them know. To decide which information is trustworthy I'd determine the veracity of the information Dr Miles relies on by checking whether it comes from credible health institutions, and whether sources like NSW share the same view on Medex. Social media is inherently unreliable, but the information could be true as long as the sources are dependable. I'd check with my clinician and with the sources above before choosing anything.
