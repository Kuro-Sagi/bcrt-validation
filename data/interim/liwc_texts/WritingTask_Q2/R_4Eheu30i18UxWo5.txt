You can't always trust people on social media, so I would be checking Dr Miles credentials, and also checking the studies summaries themselves to understand how realistic they are; if Dr Miles was taking them out of proportion, if the sample size was small, any limitations, etc. I would also call my clinician or a pharmacist and ask their information/perspective on the drug. It is a newer drug from a clinical trial, and with any drug there will always be possible side effects depending on the person, their lifestyle, etc. I would probably continue taking the drug anyway because I trust my personal clinician firstly, but I would ask a pharmacist about it, also you can't trust everyone on social media.
