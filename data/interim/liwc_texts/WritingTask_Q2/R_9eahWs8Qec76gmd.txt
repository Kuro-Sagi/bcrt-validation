When I saw the video by Dr. Herbert Miles, I felt uncertain but not panicked. These days, many people on social media pretend to be doctors or spread false medical advice just to go viral. So I knew I had to stay calm and check the facts before reacting emotionally. I would message my prescribing doctor the next morning and ask clearly: “I saw a video saying Medex could harm the liver long-term. Can you help me understand if this is true?” I would also try to book appointments with one or two other doctors for second and third opinions. To decide who is trustworthy, I’d look for official qualifications, check whether Dr. Miles is a licensed GP, and see if the medical journal articles he shows are from peer-reviewed sources. If the journals are real but misquoted, that would change everything. Before making any decision, I want solid evidence. Only after speaking to professionals and reading real studies would I decide whether to take Medex. For now, I would pause taking the medicine until I feel confident that it is safe.
