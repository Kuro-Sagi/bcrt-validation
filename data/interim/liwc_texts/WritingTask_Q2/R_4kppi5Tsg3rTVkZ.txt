I feel really confusing, because I don't know which information I should trust, and this will deeply influence my health. This is a very important decision. I will share this video to my clinician and ask if it is true. I will also sent the video to my parents then ask their advice. I prefer to trust my clinician, because there is too much fake information on social media, sometimes people post some information only for attract more viewers. I will google Medex by myself to get more information.
