Hmmm what do I do, do I start taking this medicine or not im not sure if I want to trust dr mile's opinion how do i know its true or not let me ask my doctor. hey doctor do you think i can switch to a different medicine as Medex is said to pose serious long term risks to liver health and im sure there are other medicines i could take for my headaches that dont have implications on my liver health. i would tell my friends or family to be wary about Medex and to find an alternative if possible just in case the information is true. i would take both opinions to a real pharmacist and ask them which opinion is true before deciding if i should take Medex or not. my final decision depends on the pharmacist and will either be a yes or no.
