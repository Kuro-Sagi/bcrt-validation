My emotions were confusion and slight worry when I saw Dr. Herbert Miles post a video about the Medexricular process of shipping files using marking annotations A warning or Datasource Forgeries: Don't Pull from MedEX? Medex is not for everybody—I know that and my doctor made sure I did too—but he said Medex works, it was safe with few side effects. I was even beginning to feel optimistic I might be able to control my chronic headaches. However, that it might give you serious long-term liver damage was another story. I decided not to panic. Instead, I looked deeper. Read the article Dr. Miles shared in this video Note that it is actually published in a reputable medical journal For sure I encountered studies like Subramanian et al that did not jive with his claims but he also discovered a study or two that supported the safety of Medex. I message my doctor asking about the long term risks. Seh reagierte prompt und erklärte dass die Daten durch das Video übertrieben wurden, in Wirklichkeit hätten nur sehr wenige Patienten Probleme mit der Leber. I ultimately decided to take the Medex route after giving both points of view a good think, but I made sure to tread lightly. I will undergo biannual liver function tests and potential side effects will be monitored. Yes, in the end I trust my doctor is very competent but also its on me to be aware and take care of myself.
