I would subconsciously believe that Dr Herbert Miles' remarks saved my life. I would first ask the clinical doctor about the content of this video and whether the pictures of the medical journal articles shown in it are genuine. If it were me, I would share this video with my friends and family to alert them to the harm this drug causes to the liver. I initially assumed that Dr Herbert Miles was a practicing general practitioner, and because he had scientific evidence to support it, and I was indeed unaware of the harmful effects of this drug on the liver, I would be more likely to believe him. But eventually, I went back to ask several different clinical professionals, including the doctor who prescribed the medication, about the authenticity of this video. If this drug does cause significant harm to my liver, I would choose not to take it. If not, I would follow the doctor's advice and take it.
