I’d probably message my doctor first, saying something like: “Hi, I came across a video by Dr Miles warning about liver risks from Medex. Just wondering if this is something I should be worried about?” I might even send them the link and ask for clarification. I’d also ask a close friend or family member if they’ve ever used Medex or heard anything similar, just to see if this is a widely known concern. To figure out who to trust, I’d want to look at the sources. Just because Dr Miles cites medical journals doesn’t mean he’s interpreting them correctly. I’d try to look up the articles myself or check if any official health organisations have addressed these claims. I’d also check whether Dr Miles has a history of sensationalist posts or if he’s generally respected in the field. Final decision: I’d hold off on starting Medex just for now and wait until I hear back from my doctor. It’s not worth jumping in while there’s uncertainty, but I wouldn’t dismiss the prescription entirely either, I just want more clarity before making a fully informed decision.
