At first, I feel uneasy watching Dr. Miles’ warning—my doctor said Medex was safe, but now this viral video claims serious liver risks. I pause and take a breath, reminding myself that sensational claims often spread faster than balanced facts. My instinct is to message my doctor: *"I just saw concerns about Medex’s liver effects—should I be worried?"* while also searching reputable medical sites to verify Dr. Miles’ claims. I notice his cited studies are real but involve extreme long-term use in high-risk patients, unlike my occasional dosage. The FDA’s website lists no liver warnings, and my doctor replies that the risk is minimal for my prescribed short-term use. After comparing both sides, I decide to trust my doctor’s guidance but will monitor for symptoms and avoid prolonged use. For now, I’ll take Medex as directed—but I’ll stay alert for new data.
