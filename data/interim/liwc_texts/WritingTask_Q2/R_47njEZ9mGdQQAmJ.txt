i'd probably originally feel a bit scared but then I would try and find the articles that Dr Miles is referencing and read them myself, focusing on the discussion and conclusions, as well as looking at if there were any retractions or arguments against the article when first published. I would then, based off my research, arrange a meeting with my typical GP (and if they weren't the one that prescribed me Medex I would send an email to the doctor which did) and discuss any concerns about the drug and ask them if they believe the consequences outweigh the benefits and if there is any tests (like blood or otherwise) that could be used to keep a track on my symptoms. If my general GP is the doctor who prescribed it to me depending on the results of my research I would seek a separate professional opinion.
