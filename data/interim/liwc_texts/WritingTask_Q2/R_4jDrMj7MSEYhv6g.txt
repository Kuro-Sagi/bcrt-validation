My first emotional reaction was anxiety and confusion. How could two professionals give such different views? I trust my doctor, especially since they referenced clinical trials showing that Medex is safe and effective. But seeing a popular GP online, Dr Miles, warn about serious liver damage definitely made me stop and think. I would message my doctor and say,“Hey, I just saw a video about Medex causing liver issues—can we talk about this before I start taking it?” To decide what to believe, I’d want to see the actual journal articles Dr Miles showed. Are they recent? Are they peer-reviewed? Do they directly relate to the dosage and duration I was prescribed? I’d also search for official statements from medical organisations or government health sites. I might even get a second opinion from another doctor, just to be sure. In the end, if my doctor can explain why the concerns don’t apply to my situation, and if the evidence supports their view, I’d probably still take Medex—but only after that conversation. I want to feel confident and informed, not rushed or blindly trusting either side.
