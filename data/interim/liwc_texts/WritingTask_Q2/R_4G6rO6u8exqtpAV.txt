Okay, wow… that video was kind of unsettling. My immediate gut reaction is anxiety — like, have I been misled? I trusted my doctor when they said Medex was safe, and now this GP online is saying there’s a serious risk to my liver? It makes me feel a bit betrayed, like maybe I didn’t ask enough questions at the appointment. But I also know that online videos can sometimes blow things out of proportion for clicks or attention. I’d probably message my doctor — something like: “Hey, I came across a video by Dr Herbert Miles warning about liver damage from Medex. Is there truth to this? Should I be concerned?” I might also ask a pharmacist I trust or check in with a friend who’s studying medicine, just to get more perspectives. As for figuring out what to trust — I’d want to look at the actual journal articles Dr Miles flashed in the video. Are they peer-reviewed? Recent? Are they large-scale human trials or obscure animal studies? And is Dr Miles interpreting them accurately, or cherry-picking scary data? I’d also check what reputable health bodies like the TGA (in Australia) or FDA (if this were the U.S.) have said about Medex. If they haven’t issued any serious warnings, that would give me some reassurance. Before deciding, I’d look for any official responses to Dr Miles’ claims — maybe medical associations or other doctors have weighed in. If it still feels murky, I might ask for an alternative or delay starting the medication until I have clarity. I’d hold off on starting Medex until I get a clearer answer from my doctor. My headaches are recurring, but not urgent enough to risk potential long-term liver damage — if that risk is real. I want confirmation from someone I trust medically, not just an influencer GP online, before putting something in my body regularly.
