I would initially be a bit sceptical as medical information is being discussed by a person with a large following, they could be presenting the information with the interests of a pharmaceutical company rather than patients. I would likely attempt to do my own research into the article he has discussed as showing the negative impacts of the drug, and also look into any other opinions or perspectives shared online. If i remain concerned about the drug, i would book an appointment with my doctor to discuss my concerns. if the doctor seems to take my concerns seriously, i would be happy to follow their recommendations, whether that is to take Medex or an alternative drug. If they seem to be dismissive, i would consider booking an appointment with another practitioner if i continue to have concerns.
