When I first watched Dr Miles’s video, I felt alarmed and confused. My doctor had reassured me that Medex was safe with only mild side effects, yet here was another medical professional warning about serious liver risks. I immediately thought about my health history and wondered if I might be particularly vulnerable. I would message my doctor or pharmacist straight away, summarising Dr Miles’s claims and asking for their professional opinion. To decide whose information is more trustworthy, I’d check the credibility of both sources: my prescribing doctor knows my medical history, while Dr Miles’s post might be aimed at the general public. I’d also look up the medical journals he referenced, verify if the studies were peer-reviewed, recent, and relevant to typical Medex dosages. Before making a decision, I’d seek a second medical opinion and possibly request liver function tests if I decide to proceed with the medication. My final decision would be to delay starting Medex until I get professional clarification, because protecting my long-term health outweighs the urgency of treating my headaches.
