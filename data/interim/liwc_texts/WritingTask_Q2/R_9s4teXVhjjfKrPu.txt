Wait, what? Now I’m supposed to worry about liver damage from Medex? That video is kind of unsettling, especially the medical images and Dr Miles' serious tone. But I also feel a bit skeptical it’s social media, and dramatic health warnings often get clicks. Still, I can’t ignore it completely, especially when it's about long-term effects. I’d probably message my doctor something like, “Hey, I saw a video from Dr Herbert Miles about Medex and liver risks, have you heard anything about this? Should I be concerned?” I trust my doctor and would rather get clarity from someone who knows my specific case, not a general TikTok post. To figure out what’s legit, I’d look up the articles Dr Miles mentioned, if I can find them. Are they from peer-reviewed journals? Are they recent or from obscure sources?
