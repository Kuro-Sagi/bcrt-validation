Okay, so your doctor says Medex is safe—works well, only mild side effects—and you trust them. But then Dr. Herbert Miles blows up on social media, warning about serious long-term liver damage from Medex, backing it up with journal images. Now what? Here’s the thing: the actual medical info on Medex (some versions) does show potential for short-term mild increases in liver enzymes—a temporary change that doesn’t necessarily mean serious liver damage, just a sign your liver reacts to the drug Ndrugs . And if you already have liver issues, you’re told to be cautious MedicinesFAQ . But there's no widely reported evidence that Medex causes long-term liver injury when taken properly. What’s more, if Medex-LA (a variant with phenylpropanolamine) raises its own red flags—such as stroke risk—that’s separate from any liver concern Drugs.com . Also, take a step back: yes, some over-the-counter meds can hurt the liver (especially acetaminophen, certain supplements, or chronic use) Verywell Health GoodRx —but Medex isn’t known to be one of the big offenders. So here’s where I’m leaning: your doctor's advice still feels more grounded. The influencer’s claim may stretch it if there's no clear proof of liver harm from Medex long-term. It feels like a case where social media dramatizes risk, not always with nuance. My take? Go ahead and follow your doctor's guidance. But if you’re still shaken, it’s totally cool to ask for a simple liver function test next time you’re at the clinic just to cover your bases.
