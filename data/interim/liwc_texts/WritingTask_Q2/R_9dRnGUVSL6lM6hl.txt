When first see dr miles video, honestly, I feel kind of worried. The doctor who gave me made said it was safe,l but now this gp online I stalking about serious liver problem. it makes me feel confused should I trust my own doctor or the guy with all the followers on social media. My first thought is to message my doctor or maybe call the clinic. is this real should I be worried about taking meed? I would probably ask my family if they have heard about this as well.I try to think about which information is more trustworthy. My doctor knows my health history and talked about the official clinical trials. Dr Miles has a lot of followers, but sometimes people online want to get more views. Before I decide, I’d check some other medical websites, maybe look up Medex on the official health authority page, or ask a pharmacist what they think. If there’s still no big warning on trusted sites, and my doctor says it’s safe for me, I would probably start taking Medex as prescribed.
