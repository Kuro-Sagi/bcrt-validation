Watching Dr Miles' video first made me anxious—my doctor said Medex was safe, but this warning about liver risks felt alarming. I’d message my doctor right away: “I saw Dr Miles’ video on Medex’s liver risks. Should I be worried? What do you think?” To check credibility, I’d look at the studies Dr Miles cited—are they peer-reviewed? I’d also ask my doctor for their source of info. I’ll hold off on taking Medex for now. Until I get clear answers from my doctor or more research, it feels safer to wait.
