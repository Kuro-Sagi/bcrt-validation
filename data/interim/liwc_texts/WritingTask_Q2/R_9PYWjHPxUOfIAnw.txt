I would have doubts about the doctor's decision, but I will not believe Dr Herbert Miles completely. I will ask my doctor about this confusion, I want to know what they think about it. I don't think I would believe any of these information, the reaction of drugs on everyone is different, and Dr Herbert Miles or any other doctor have not published any papers for this opinion. I will decide to use Medex, I will drink more water and do sports everyday to reduce liver burden.
