I would be skeptical with Dr Miles as some people might just do it for attention or cause some drama, or even just cherry picking information and claims. I would most likely contact my doctor to ask them about it, however I doubt that would do any good as thing is, the doctor would most likely just go ahead with it and dismiss the other doctors. I might do some research on Dr Miles claims and the articles that he has used to back up his points, but ultimate will likely to trust my doctor over some guy online.
