A, Initially I would be a bit slightly cautious about the drug, however since I was prescribed the drug by the doctor, I would still consider taking it, especially since not all things on social media can be trusted. B, I might tell my friends about the slightly suspicious drug and ask them for advice on whether to take it or not, but other than that, I don't think I would be suspicious enough to trust a random GP on the internet over my actual physical GP. C, I think that my gut tells me to follow my actual GP over the GP on the internet, as although Dr Miles says that the drug would pose long term risk to liver health, there may be missing details on what exactly causes this risk such as the dosage or the frequency of taking the drug. Also, although he showed images of medical journal articles, it is easy to find academic or trustworthy looking journals on the internet that support any argument. D, I would probably do some quick checks by doing a search on the internet or maybe some forums about the drug, to see if the claims by Dr Miles are true. Also I think that I might look to see if any of the people in my inner circle have tried the drugs and experienced any symptoms. Ultimately, I think that if i was really really worried, I would get a second opinion by a different GP or ask the same GP about these claims.
