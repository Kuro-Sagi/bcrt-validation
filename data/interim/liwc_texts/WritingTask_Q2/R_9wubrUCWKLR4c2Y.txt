my immediate response is that dr miles is right. I would show my clinician the journal articles Dr Miles shared and discuss my concerns with them. I trust both information but believe it is possible the drug is being slightly misrepresented by clinicians due to what I imagine is a fairly slim likelihood of liver problems. I would also perform my own research to bring to my clinician. I believe dr Miles is right, as medication can often be misunderstood and he has medical journal articles to support his claims.
