Watching Dr. Miles’ video made me uneasy—my doctor said Medex was safe, but now I’m hearing about liver risks. I trust my doctor, but the journal images in the video seem convincing. I’d message my clinician: “Is there any truth to these claims about Medex?” I’d also check reputable medical sites for balanced info. Since comments on the video are mixed, I won’t panic. I’ll wait for my doctor’s response and maybe research the studies Dr. Miles cited. If my headaches stay mild, I’ll delay taking Medex until I’m sure.
