When I saw the vedio, I might start to question Dr Herbert Miles' identity, because in th online world, it is easy for things to be fabricated or faked. I would probably visit his profile to check his other vedios or see if there is any information about his credentials. After that, I would verify whether the journal articles he cited are accurate. I will try to find the source of the article. I don't doubt the doctor who originally predcribed the medication, but when it comes to health-related matters, I believe it is important to be cautious. So I would choose a reputable hospital and consult a new doctor to ask for another opinion and a new prescription. If the new doctor also recommends the same medication , I would follow the advice and let the matter go. However, if a different drug is prescribed, I would choose the new one and continue to monitor the situation to see if any new evidence comes out.
