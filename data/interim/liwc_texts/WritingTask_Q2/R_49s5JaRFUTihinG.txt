I would have thoughts of distrust and confusion around the true safety of the medicine, where I would question whether its truly safe or not. I would further send my doctor the video by Dr Herbet Miles to my local GP and ask him to debunk or disregard the allegations made towards the true safety of the medicine. I think to would still ultimately decide the medicine is trustworthy as it must have needed to go through intense medical trials to be put on prescription. I would ask around still and be extra cautious in taking the medicine
