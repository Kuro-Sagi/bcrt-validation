When I saw the video by Dr. Miles, I felt nervous and confused. The idea of long-term liver damage sounded scary, especially since my doctor didn’t mention it. I started to wonder: Did my doctor miss something? Or is the video exaggerating? I sent the video to my doctor and asked, “What do you think about this? Should I be worried?” I also talked to my older sister, who’s a pharmacist. She told me to look at the actual research articles, not just social media posts. So I searched online and found one of the studies Dr. Miles showed. It did mention liver effects, but only in very rare cases with very high doses. I also found that Medex has been approved by medical authorities and used safely by many patients. In the end, I decided to take the medicine, but I will follow the doctor’s instructions carefully and do a liver check-up after a month. I think that’s a balanced and safe choice.
