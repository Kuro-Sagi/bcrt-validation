Wow okay so my doctor may have just lied to my face. Dr Miles seems legit, unlike those 'medical professionals' that claim chia seed water will cure diabetes, I mean they even showed the reliable evidence. I should ask my family and friends whether they think Medex is safe or not. I should also discuss with my clinician if there are any alternative medications in case I choose not to take the medication. I'll look into the articles Dr Miles has shared and find anything that counterargues their findings. The more evidence that supports Dr Miles' claim, the more inclined I am to trust their judgement. I'm choosing not to take Medex since this is serious side-effect that my doctor neglected to tell me about.
