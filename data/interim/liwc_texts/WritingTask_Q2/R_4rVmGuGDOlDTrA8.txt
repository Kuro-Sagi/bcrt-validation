Ugh, this is stressful. My first reaction is panic - liver damage sounds terrifying. But then I remember how much medical misinformation gets spread on social media, even by people with credentials. I need to think about this rationally. Dr. Miles might be a real GP, but having a "large online following" doesn't make him more credible than my prescribing doctor. Social media incentivises dramatic content that gets engagement. The fact that he's "warning" about risks that patients "aren't informed about" sounds like typical fear-mongering language. The mixed comments are telling - if other medical professionals are saying the data is misrepresented, that's a red flag. I should look up these journal articles myself rather than trust his interpretation. Are they recent? High-quality studies? Is he showing the full context or just cherry-picked excerpts? My prescribing doctor would have access to comprehensive safety data and prescribing guidelines. They're also accountable to medical boards, unlike social media influencers. I'll ring their surgery tomorrow to discuss liver risks specifically, but I'm not going to panic based on one viral video. Final decision: Start taking Medex as prescribed. My doctor's evidence-based recommendation outweighs a social media video, but I'll follow up to discuss any concerns directly with them.
