This video is unsettling. My initial reaction was anxiety and confusion. I had just been reassured by my doctor, and now I see a doctor with a large online following saying that Medex could cause long-term damage to my liver? That's terrifying. Part of me wants to throw these medications away immediately. But I'm also a little sceptical—how do I know who's right? I might send the doctor a message or call the clinic and ask directly, ‘I watched a video warning that Medex could cause liver damage. Should I be concerned about this?’
