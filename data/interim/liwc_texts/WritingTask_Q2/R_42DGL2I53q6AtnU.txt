Firstly, I would feel a little cautious, as I have received largely different endorsements of the drug from two practicing doctors. I would first read the comments saying the data is misrepresented, and gather some general trends amongst the comments. I would then try to skim some of the medical journal articles Dr Miles has referenced and ascertain for myself if the data is misrepresented. Following this, I would message my clinician with the video and what I had read in the journals and ask for their perspective on it. If they provide a convincing argument against Mike, I would feel comfortable taking Medex - if they do not address this long-term risk to liver health, I would probably ask for alternatives, or get the opinion of another doctor. My final choice lies in how my clinician addresses the video.
