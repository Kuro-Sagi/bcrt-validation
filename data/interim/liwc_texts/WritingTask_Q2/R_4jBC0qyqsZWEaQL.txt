At first, I would be confused and a little scared, because I would need to take this medication. I would probably forward the video to my friend or family member to ask if they have any relevant knowledge or insight. I would then search the internet, and most likely, I would first use the AI to ask for knowledge about the medication. If possible, I would look up the academic journal article mentioned in the video and give the article to the AI for judgment, as I do not have the relevant general medical knowledge. If the AI's response is the same as in the video, then I will contact my doctor to discuss my concerns and distress and stop taking the medication until I can talk to my doctor. If both of the AI's responses can prove that the medication has no or only ignored side effects, then I would continue to take the medication.
