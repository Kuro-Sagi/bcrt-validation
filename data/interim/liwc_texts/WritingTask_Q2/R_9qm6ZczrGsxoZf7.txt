Due to the nature of this scenario I would be conflicted whether to trust the recommendation of my GP while also taking into account the advice of Dr Herbert Miles. However, understanding the nature of social media posting I would imagine that the information that Dr Miles reports on may not be 100% accurate and would thus require me to check his sources for the root of what he is saying. If I were to return to my GP with the concerns that the social media post had raised I would ask if there was an alternative medication that I could take instead.
