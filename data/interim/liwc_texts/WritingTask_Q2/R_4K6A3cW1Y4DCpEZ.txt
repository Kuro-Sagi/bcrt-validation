My first gut reaction is definitely anxiety I feel a bit blindsided. I trusted what my doctor told me, and now here’s this seemingly reputable GP online saying there’s a serious risk I wasn’t warned about. I feel torn between wanting relief from these awful headaches and not wanting to damage my liver long-term. It’s frustrating and confusing. I’d probably message a close friend or family member and say, “Hey, have you heard anything bad about Medex? Just saw this video and now I’m second-guessing what the doctor said.” I might even screenshot the video and send it to them for their opinion. I don’t fully trust a social media post, even if it’s from a doctor especially if it’s gone viral. But I also don’t want to ignore it. I’d try to look up the articles Dr Miles cited to see if they really support what he’s claiming, and maybe check Medex on the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) website or Healthdirect. I’d also call or message my doctor and say, “I saw this video warning about liver risks with Medex can we talk about whether this is a real concern?” Ultimately, I’d hold off on taking Medex until I’ve spoken to my GP again. I still value their professional opinion, but I want to be better informed. I don’t want to risk my liver health without knowing the full picture.
