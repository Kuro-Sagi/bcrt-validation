Don't think I would really care as my doctor would know about the side effects and warn their patients before hand is generally how doctors operate. Also, I try not to believe everything on social media especially when their are a lot of mixed comments. I might send it to my family(parents) as they are older and have more life experience then me and they would just tell me like what they think and guide me to make the right decision. But I truly believe that there is a lot of fake news on social media. I would take the medicine and if I had another check up in the future with the doctor I might just ask if there are any side effect also would ask the pharmacist before buying.
