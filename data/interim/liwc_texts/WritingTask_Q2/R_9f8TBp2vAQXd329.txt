When I come across that video, I will definitely be worried and I will certainly panic. After seeing that video, I would message my doctor and send him the link of the video, and asked if what the video is saying is correct or not to make sure. I would certainly not only ask the doctor, I would go to the nearest pharmacy and ask the pharmacist if whatever the video is saying correct or not. I would also read the articles being shown in the video to see if Dr Herbert Miles is right or wrong. I would also search up about this in the internet. If most of the answer that I got said that Dr Herbert Miles is right then I would not consume the medicine given and I would just go to the nearest pharmacy and ask for another medicine for my illness.
