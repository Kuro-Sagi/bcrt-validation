I would be suspicious at first, taking information from an online video and would instead place more trust in my own doctor. However, I would look into the articles Dr Miles used to substantiate his claims and read them for myself and see how trustworthy they are, as well as looking into other medical journals to see how many concur these ideas. I would also contact my clinician with these concerns to see their perspective, and perhaps ask around if any friends have had experience taking the same medication. I think ultimately I would take the advice of my clinician as they are most aware of what I need.
