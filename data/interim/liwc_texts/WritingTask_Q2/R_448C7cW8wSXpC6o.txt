First and foremost, I would be worried. I'd message my clinician and ask for some clarification on the topic. I would like to trust my clinician but probably would not land all my faith onto them, so i would take it to reddit to see what other people say to fact check it. I would probably stay on the medication anyway and won't think much of the side effects because I don't want a self fulfilling prophecy.
