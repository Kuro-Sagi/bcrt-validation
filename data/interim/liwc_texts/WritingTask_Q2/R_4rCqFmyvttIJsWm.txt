A. My immediate thoughts would be doubt and likely anxiety, even if it was untrue just because its uncommon for someone to directly have an interest in denying a treatment works. I might also just be incredibly skeptical of Dr. Miles to the point of derision and eyerolling. B. I would do further research before going to my clinician for anything, maybe go to a 2nd one for a 2nd opinion. I'd probably vent to friends and family, or just poke fun at it. C. I'd take it from a variety of sources, but likely not in the form of short videos. I'd see if there's a literature basis, and if some bloggers have spoken about it, or I'd just measure my body itself and see how my liver is doing. D. I would have utmost faith in my own bodily systems for my wellbeing, but for online sources I'd simply see if their opinions line up with my existing solid ones first.
