Dr Miles seemed confident, and the medical article screenshots looked legit. But then again… he’s also got a huge online presence, and sometimes people with a following lean into fear-based content to get more engagement. Still, if there is a real risk, I don’t want to ignore it just because I already got a prescription. I think I’d send my doctor a quick message or book a short follow-up. Maybe I'll say “Hi, I came across a video by Dr Herbert Miles claiming that Medex may have long-term liver risks. Just wanted to check if you’re aware of this and whether it’s something I should be worried about?” I’ll hold off on taking Medex until I get a firm answer. I don’t want to overreact to one video, but I also want to make sure I'm making an informed choice, especially since it’s about long-term liver health.
