When I first watched Dr. Herbert Miles’ video about Medex, I felt confused and a bit worried. I had just seen my doctor earlier that day, and she told me Medex was safe and effective, with only mild side effects. Now this popular doctor online was warning about serious long-term liver damage? It felt like a contradiction, and I didn’t know who to believe at first. I wanted to message my doctor right away and ask, “Have you seen this video? Is it true what he says about liver damage?” I also thought about sending the video to a couple of friends or family members to hear their opinions. I trust my doctor, but seeing someone with a big following speak so confidently made me question things. Before making any decision, I would do a few things: 1. Look up the journal articles Dr. Miles showed in his video and see if his interpretation matches the actual research. 2. Check whether those studies were recent, peer-reviewed, and supported by other research. 3. Look for other expert opinions from reliable medical websites or healthcare professionals—not just social media. After reviewing everything, if there’s no strong scientific evidence to support his claims, and if my own doctor assures me again that Medex is safe for my condition, I would decide to **go ahead and take Medex**. I trust the medical advice from a trained professional who knows my health history more than a social media post, even if it’s from a licensed doctor. But I’ll also ask to monitor my liver just in case, and stay alert to any new research.
