If I saw that post my initial gut reaction would be some sort of anxiety or terror. And then I think I would read through the comments, but try to stop myself because that would just send me into a whole spiral of anxiety and worry. I would immediately search up articles online, also I would definitely look at where Dr Miles got this information and data from, (ie any sort of research, articles and also maybe some other information from further medical clinicians). Then I would message my friends or acquaintances, maybe people who have used this medicine before and ask them. But most importantly I would ask my doctor, and also maybe go to several other GPs and ask for their opinions. After collecting sufficient information I would decide whether to continue to use this medicine or not.
