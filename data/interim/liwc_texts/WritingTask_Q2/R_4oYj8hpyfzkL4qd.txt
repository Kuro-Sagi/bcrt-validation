My immediate reaction would be concerned and unwilling to take the medication. I’d try to look up the studies he showed and check if any health sites or official pages warn about Medex. I’d want to hear my doctor’s explanation before taking it. I’d wait to start Medex until I’ve talked to my GP and checked the info myself. Better to be safe than sorry.
