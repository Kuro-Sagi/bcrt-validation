First of all, I will feel extremely confused. Next, I will discuss this matter with my friends to evaluate the claims of these two doctors, as well as the genuine reactions of the netizens, and explore the potential mechanism of action of this drug. I think I might have been influenced by Dr. Herbert Myers to question my doctor because he is more authoritative. I will carefully read these comments and discuss with my doctor again whether to continue taking this drug or if there are other alternative drugs that can serve as substitutes. I think I will probably replace this drug because I believe more in the opinions of the actual netizens, especially in this situation where the conclusion is unclear, the actual feelings for me are more convincing.
