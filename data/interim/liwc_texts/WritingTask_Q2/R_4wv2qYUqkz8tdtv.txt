Depends on how Dr Miles deliver his video. If it is Mr Beast styled i will take it a lot less seriously. Regardless i'll probably just look at a few comments and go away to look at another video. However, if the video really concerns me, i may inquire on my family and friends who had used medex before. First hand experience is better than whatever someone says online. But if no one i know used medex before, i will inquire a pharmacist (not the doctor i got medex from, its likely he restates whatever he said before). If he supports the doctor, then there's 2 experienced GP vs 1 practice GP, i will take medex. If he supports Dr Miles instead, then i will seek alternatives But it's likely that i will take the medicine anyways without inquire further, people online especially influencers are not reliable sources and will make things up for following
