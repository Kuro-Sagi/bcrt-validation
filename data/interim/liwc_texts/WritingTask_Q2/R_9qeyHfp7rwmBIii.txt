Okay, that video really caught me off guard. I just got prescribed Medex today, and my doctor said it’s safe with only mild side effects. But now Dr. Herbert Miles, who seems credible and has a big following, is warning about serious long-term liver risks? And he even showed medical journal images to back it up. That’s pretty worrying. But then again, the comments are mixed, like some people say the data might be misrepresented, so maybe it’s not as clear-cut as he makes it seem. I don’t want to ignore a potential risk, especially something serious like liver damage. But I also don’t want to panic over social media claims without solid proof. I think I should check with my doctor again and maybe bring up this video and ask for their perspective on these concerns. In the meantime, I’ll probably hold off on taking Medex until I get more clarity. It’s important to be cautious but not jump to conclusions based on one video alone.
