The video would make me second guess my choice. However, I trust my doctor, but seeing another GP claim Medex harms the liver makes me want to double-check. I’d probably send the video to my doctor and ask if it’s something to worry about. I’d look up Medex on official health websites to see if liver issues are a known side effect. Until I get a clear answer, I’d hold off on taking it.
