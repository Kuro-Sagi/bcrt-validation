My immediate reaction would be to stop taking it (depending on whether it was a medication that could be stopped without taper or anything - either way I would start research immediately) I would begin with searching the medication online, and seeing what the general consensus was - if it seemed like Dr Miles was the only media coming up, and other articles seemed to think it was fine I would probably ignore it/bring it up with my regular doctor at our next appointment, but not specifically make an appointment to ask. If most things did seem to say it could lead to liver failure, I would probably stop taking it and research other medications that can help with headaches that do not have these side effects, and bring it up with my doctor the next time I went, both to ask their opinion on the media, and to ask about alternatives I could try.
