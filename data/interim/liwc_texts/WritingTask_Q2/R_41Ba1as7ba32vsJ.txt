I would not be worried as I have seen multiple examples of people just lying online - I would much rather trust my own doctor than this guy online. I would probably not mention it to my friends or family apart from just in random conversation as some stupid guy online to laugh at, but I probably would bring it up to my clinician. I'd probably get him to take a look at the video and just kind of walk me through each part of the side effects presented by Dr Herbert Miles. The fact that medical journal articles support this claim doesn't really add much weight, as I understand that medicine is a field that is still very much developing and you could just as easily find studies supporting it as against it, something which I might be inclined to check. Thus I would start taking Medex as if nothing happened.
