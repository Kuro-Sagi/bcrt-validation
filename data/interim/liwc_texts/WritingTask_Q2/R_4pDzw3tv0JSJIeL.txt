My first reaction is worry — liver damage sounds serious, and I feel uneasy about taking Medex now. But at the same time, I remind myself that my doctor, who knows my medical history, recommended it and said the side effects are mild. Social media posts can be sensationalised to get attention, even if they show “evidence.” I’d probably message my doctor or call the clinic tomorrow, saying something like, “I saw a video by Dr Herbert Miles warning about liver damage from Medex — is this a real concern?” I might also ask friends or family if they’ve heard anything similar, just to see if this is widely discussed. To judge the trustworthiness, I’d look at whether Dr Miles cited recent peer-reviewed research or if the articles are old or taken out of context. I’d also check reputable health websites or government advisories. Final decision: I’ll start Medex as prescribed for now because my headaches are recurring and my doctor assessed it as safe for me. But I’ll follow up with my doctor soon to clarify the liver risk and possibly explore alternatives if there’s solid evidence.
