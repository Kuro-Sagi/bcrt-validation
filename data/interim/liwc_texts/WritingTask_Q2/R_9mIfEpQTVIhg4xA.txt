I am immediately suspicious of the information stated in the video. Despite his following, I would question his qualifications and sources immediately as it is easy to fake information online. I would the look up papers and consult the medications Australia website to check all reported side effects and cross reference what I find with both what my GP and what the video said. If I was concerned about what I found I would also contact my GP again the next day to discuss what ive found and get there opinion. Ultimately I would wait to start the medication until talking with the GP if I was still concerned.
