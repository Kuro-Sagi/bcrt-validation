A. I would feel wronged by my doctor and upset that he abused his authority and prescribed a harmful drug to me. B. I don't think I would say anything to my doctor personally, or at least not before reaching out to friends and family with the situation and advice on what I should do. I would probably forward the video to them and explain what happened earlier that day. C. Since there are medical journal articles that support his claim, I'd rather not take the risk and continue to use Medex. D. I would make sure to do my own research to make sure that these articles are a reliable source and not just something he manipulated to suit his audience. I would also try to seek other professional advice, outside of the video and my own doctor. I definitely would not use Medex because of Dr Miles' claims as the long-term effects could be irreversible and could end up costing me more money in the future to maintain.
