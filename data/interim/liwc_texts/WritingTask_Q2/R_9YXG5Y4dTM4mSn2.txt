Whilst I would immediately feel concerned upon reading the article, I know that a lot of information on social media is not fully trustworthy. I would go and read the medical journal articles by the GP and see if the data supports his claim or whether they have been misrepresented. I would then do additional research and see if other trustworthy medical information sites, e.g. medical journals, government websites, have similar warnings to what the GP said, using search terms that both support and oppose the presence of severe side effects. If there is a chance that the GP's advice is true, then I would consult my doctor and a pharmacist about this risk and follow their advice. If they say that this risk is possible, then I would ask for an alternative prescription, otherwise I would continue the prescription if the risk is minimal.
