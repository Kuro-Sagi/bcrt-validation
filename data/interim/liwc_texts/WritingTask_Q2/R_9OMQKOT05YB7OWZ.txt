My immediate reaction would be just a slight concern on whether the medicine side effects could impact me negatively, and call the doctor to probably talk about it in detail, but even then that stage would be unlikely because I don't usually trust popular doctors on social media, as they usually like to clickbait for clout. If I do feel doubt, I would try and check the linked articles in the video for myself first and see if the side effects impacted the majority or the minority, the sample etc, how the experiment or trial was conducted, and why that could be the case. At the end of the day, I would trust a doctor who personally reviewed my symptoms and history over a viral video
