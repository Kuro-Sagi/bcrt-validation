When I watched Dr. Miles’s video, I felt instantly alarmed. The idea that Medex might cause serious liver damage was shocking, especially since my own doctor had told me it was safe with minimal side effects. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, so I decided to double-check. I searched for the article Miles had cited, and it was indeed real, but the study was based on a small sample and used much higher doses than what I had been prescribed. I also looked up responses from other medical professionals online—some agreed with Miles, but others argued he had exaggerated the risks. To be safe, I called my doctor the next morning. She patiently explained that the liver concerns were extremely rare and mostly related to long-term overuse. She also offered to run regular liver function tests if I was worried. In the end, I chose to take Medex, but more cautiously, under supervision. I valued my doctor’s clinical advice and appreciated her willingness to support me through regular checkups.
