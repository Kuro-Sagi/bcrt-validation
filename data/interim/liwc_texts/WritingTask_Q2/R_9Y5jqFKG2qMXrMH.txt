y first gut reaction is confusion and anxiety. The doctor I trust said Medex is safe with minimal side effects, but now here’s this GP online claiming there are serious long-term liver risks? And he’s showing screenshots of journal articles, so it looks legit—but social media can be such a mixed bag. Part of me wonders: is this real science or sensationalism for clicks? Also, why didn’t my own doctor mention this? Before panicking, I think I’d message my clinician—maybe send them the video link and ask, “Hey, I just came across this post about Medex. Is this something I should be worried about? Have you heard of any new research on liver risks?” I trust their medical opinion more than someone online, even if that person is a GP. But I still want to check—sometimes new studies come out that not every doctor sees right away. As for figuring out what’s trustworthy, I’d want to actually look at the articles Dr Miles cited, myself. Are these real peer-reviewed studies from reputable journals? Are they case reports, large-scale trials, or just speculative editorials? And are the risks relevant to someone like me—taking Medex for headaches occasionally—or are they talking about people who take it daily for years? I’d also check official sources: maybe go on the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) website or check other medical guidelines to see if any updated warnings about Medex have been posted. If this was a massive concern, I’d expect to see it reflected in mainstream health advisories, not just one viral video.
