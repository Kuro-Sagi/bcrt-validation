I would feel some what paranoid and disturbed. To reassure myself, I would instead consult to another doctor for better clarification, it's not ideal to rely on every information from social media. I myself don't view social media as a reliable source of information (especially medical information) regardless of the following. Up front (in-person) consultation with a certified doctor is my only reliable source, i can discuss with them about the consequences and bad influences of this medication which I've heard from social media. Rather than leaving those worries unattended, I can discuss with a doctor for them to give better clarification. Most of the time, social media is used to express the extremities of certain scenarios for entertainment, it's best to have it clarified with a professional in person. If the doctor says it's ok to intake the medicine with certain protocols, then I will take Medex.
