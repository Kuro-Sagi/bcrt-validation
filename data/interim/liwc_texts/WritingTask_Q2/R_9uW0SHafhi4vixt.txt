When I saw the video, I felt confused and a little scared. My doctor said Medex is safe and helps with headaches, but now a popular doctor online says it could hurt my liver in the long run. Who should I believe? I would send the video to my doctor and ask, “What do you think about this?” I trust my doctor because they know my health history. I would also ask if they have seen those studies before. To decide what is true, I would look at the sources. Dr Miles shows journal articles, but I don’t know if he is showing all the facts or just the scary parts. Maybe he is trying to get more views online. Before I take the medicine, I would look up the studies myself and check if real health websites like the government or Mayo Clinic say anything about liver problems. In the end, I would not take Medex yet. I want to wait until my doctor replies and I know more. It’s better to be careful than take a risk.
