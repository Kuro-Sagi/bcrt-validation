A. I'd probably be wary, but take into account that what people say in social media are not always true. B. I wouldn't say anything unless there are several pointed studies that actually prove this, but I'd send the post to my family/friends to tell them not to use it until proven otherwise. C. Medical reports/studies that have been done by trustworthy resources and companies. Since people can say whatever they want in social media. D. I'd probably not take Medex at this point if it is a fairly newly found drug, but if it's been proven in time that it isn't harmful according to trusthworthy reports, then I'll keep using it.
