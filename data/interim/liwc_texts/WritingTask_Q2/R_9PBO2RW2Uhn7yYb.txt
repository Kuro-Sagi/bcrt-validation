I think I’ll message my doctor first: “Hi, I came across a video from Dr Herbert Miles saying Medex could harm liver health in the long run. Just wanted to check — is this a known risk? Should I be concerned?” At the same time, I’ll search PubMed or look up official drug safety information from health authorities like the FDA or the Australian TGA. I’ll check for systematic reviews, not just cherry-picked articles. Also, I’d see if Dr Miles has a history of sensational claims or if he’s respected in the medical community. Final decision: I’ll wait before taking Medex.
