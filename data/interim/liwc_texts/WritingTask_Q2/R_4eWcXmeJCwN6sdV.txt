I would at first be weary of the infomation. I would check to see if there are other doctors/ gps online that say the same thing, however ultimately I wouldn't be able to determine if the data is being misrepresented or not. I would probably go back or call the orginal doctor and explain the situation and what I am seeing online, and ask them to verify if it is true. If i still was satisified with the answer I would seek a second opinion. I think it would be irresponsible to completely trust a doctor online, however equally irresposnible to blindly trust one opinion (the orginal doctor). I would probably also just do a google search of the medicines name and see what comes up online, however be careful to just read the infomation to help gain a balanced perspective or any questions when speaking to an actual professional.
