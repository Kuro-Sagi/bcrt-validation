I would ask for advice from my friends/family to see what they think. Initially, I would definitely be concerned if I saw Dr Miles saying negative consequences of the drug, due to his large following, and claiming to be a practising GP. Nevertheless, people, particularly 'influencers' (those who make income from posting), on the internet shouldn't be a primary source of information. Therefore, I would do my own research outside of just his video. Depending on how much of this further information is in support or against him, I would form an opinion on the drug from there.
