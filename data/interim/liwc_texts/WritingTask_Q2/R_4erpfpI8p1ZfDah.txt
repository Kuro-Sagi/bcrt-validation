i would be shocked at first that i wasnt informed by my doctor but then read more into the comments and do my own research. if i am still concerned about Medex i will book another doctors appointment with a different doctor and get a second professional opinion. but im sure that my own research will help me understand whether the risk to liver health is real or misrepresented. but i would stop taking Medex until i was sure and confident in the side effects.
