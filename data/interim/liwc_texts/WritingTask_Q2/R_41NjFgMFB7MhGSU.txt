When I first watch the video, I feel mix of doubt and fear. The claim that Medex could harm my liver is unsettling, especially since my doctor assured me it was safe and minimal side effects. The images of medical journals make the warning feel urgent but I also think about why my physician wouldn't have mentioned such a serious risk. The conflicting comments under the post add up my confusion. Some people seem grateful for the warning while others say Dr.Miles misrepresent data. I would contact my doctor for clarification and send message "I saw video about Medex has long-term liver risks that wasn't discussed during my appointment. Can you help me understand if this is a credible concern?" I'll also research more and check for reliable resources such as Medex's official leaflet for listed side effects. After gathering more information, I would continue taking Medex ad prescribed but stay cautious. But, I'll follow up with my doctor if new concerns rise up.
