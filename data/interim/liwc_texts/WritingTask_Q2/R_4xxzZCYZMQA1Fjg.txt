I think i definitely would be skeptical of Medex as if a famous online doctor is saying it's dangerous, then i should look at the medical journal myself and see if its correct. It's easy to believe information online especially if its supposedly from someone reputable like a doctor online, however its important to check their credentials. I think that i would do my research first before i made a decision about whether Medex was safe to use but i would more skeptical of the online information first.
