**Thinking Aloud (Medex Decision-Making):** Wow, that video was intense. My first reaction? Worry. I trusted my doctor when she said Medex was safe with only mild side effects. Now this well-known GP online is saying it could harm my liver long-term? That’s not something I can ignore, especially when he even showed medical journal screenshots. But then again… people in the comments are saying the data might be exaggerated or taken out of context. That makes me question it too. I think I’d text my doctor or maybe book a quick call: *“Hey, I just saw a post from Dr Miles about Medex and liver risks. Should I be concerned?”* I don’t want to sound like I’m doubting her—but I also want to make an informed decision. I’d also look up the studies Dr Miles referenced, check if they’re recent, peer-reviewed, and whether the risks were long-term and under what dosage. To be honest, I don’t fully trust viral social media posts, even if they come from doctors. Information without proper context can easily be misused. So, until I speak to my doctor and maybe even get a second opinion or check my liver history, I’ll hold off on taking Medex. My health is worth double-checking. Final decision: pause and verify before taking.
